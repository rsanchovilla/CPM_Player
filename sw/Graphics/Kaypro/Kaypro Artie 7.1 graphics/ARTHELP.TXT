                               B0B1 Pointer Movement C0C1

Use the numerical keypad to move the pointer: B0B1 1 C0C1 = southwest, B0B1 2 C0C1 = south etc.
Striking B0B1 5 C0C1 causes the pointer to move 5 spaces right, and B0B1 0 C0C1 homes the
pointer while remembering its current position, which can be recovered with
B0B1 LINE FEED C0C1.

Use B0B1 ^X C0C1 to scroll to the upper or lower part of the 24-line drawing-board.

                            B0B1 Painting with Graphics C0C1

Select a palette by putting the pointer on the top line under the number you
want, then striking B0B1 ENTER C0C1.  To select a graphic, move the pointer with B0B1 5 C0C1
until it is under the block you want, then strike B0B1 ENTER C0C1 again. The graphic is
now loaded in the "brush" and will be remembered until you select another one.
The first block on palette 1 will load the brush with spaces. B0B1 ^A C0C1 loads the
brush with the character and special effects from any cell on the screen.

Now move down onto the screen and, when you wish to start painting, strike
B3B0B1 ENTER C0C1C3 once more. From now on you can toggle the brush on B0*C0 and off B0^C0 with
the B0B1 ENTER C0C1 key. To erase, strike B0B1 DEL C0C1. The pointer will look like this B0#C0
and will delete any character above it until you strike B0B1 DEL C0C1 again.

Toggling either the brush or the eraser will automatically turn off the other
one.  In addition, both functions are switched off whenever the pointer is put
at the top line, when text is typed, and after various other operations.

                             B0B1 Drawing with Pixels C0C1

B0B1 ^P C0C1 begins pixel-drawing. Move the flashing pixel with the number keys.
Toggle drawing mode with B3B0B1 ENTER C0C1C3 or erasing mode with B0B1 DEL C0C1, or cancel either
of these with B0B1 0 C0C1. Strike B3B0B1 5 C3C0C1 to draw a pixel and the space bar to erase
one without changing modes.

B0B1 ESC C0C1 or B0B1 ^P C0C1 returns you to normal painting.

                                B0B1 Fill and Empty C0C1

Rectangular areas can be filled in rapidly with any character.  After loading
the brush, go to a blank space in the upper left corner of the area to be
filled and strike B0B1 ^F C0C1. To erase a block of identical characters, go to the
upper left corner of the block and strike B0B1 ^E C0C1.

Clear the entire screen by striking B0B1 ESC C C0C1. Erase any rectangle with cut-and-
paste (see next screen).


[ ESC to return, any other key for next frame. ]
                                B0B1 Cut and Paste C0C1

Any rectangular part of the screen can be cut as a block by marking first the
lower right corner and then the upper left corner with B0B1 ^C C0C1. The whole screen
can be marked by homing the pointer and striking B0B1 ^C C0C1 once. The block will
remain in memory till a new one is cut, and B0B1 ^K C0C1 gives the menu for further
operations. B0B1 ^KA C0C1 adds to the block any special effects that are toggled, or
gives a negative image if B0B1 ^I C0C1 is on.

                                B0B1 Writing Text C0C1

You can add text to the screen at any time simply by typing, but the pointer
cannot be moved with DEL or RETURN. The pointer will drop down when it reaches
the edge of the screen. B0B1 BACK SPACE C0C1 will print spaces backwards and wrap up to
the end of the preceding line.

With B0B1 ^T C0C1 you can enter a line of text in big letters. ARTFONT is the default
character set but you can load any fontfile with B0B1 ^N C0C1. Fontfiles can be edited
with pixel graphics.

                               B0B1 Special Effects C0C1

The special video effects can be toggled with B0B1 ^U C0C1 (underline), B0B1 ^I C0C1 (invert),
B0B1 ^D C0C1 (dim), and B0B1 ^B C0C1 (blink). They can be used in any combination. All are
turned off whenever the pointer is sent home.

                    B0B1 Saving, Reading, and Printing Files C0C1

Save a screen with B0B1 ^S C0C1. Save a detail by cutting it, then typing B0B1 ^KS C0C1.
To call up a screen from the disk, put the pointer on the top line and
then strike B0B1 ^R C0C1. Read in a detail by placing the pointer under the top left
corner of the area where you want the detail and then striking B0B1 ^R C0C1. If the
erasing toggle is off, the new image will merge with the old. Set the approp-
riate toggles to dim, blink, invert, or underline the detail as it is read in.

A filename can be up to 8 letters; ARTIE will add the extension .ART to
screen files and .ARD to detail files. Use B0B1 ^L C0C1 to set the default disk
drive and get a list of files.

Exit ARTIE to print files with B0B1 ESC P C0C1, or use B0B1 ^G C0C1 to send the screen image
to an Epson-type printer.

  B0B1 END OF HELP SCREENS. Strike ESC to return, any other key to read again. C0C1
