GENERAL:

BARGRAPH.COM  and BARGRAPH.DOC form a graphics package for the '84 Kaypros. 
Subsequently  it  should  work  only in those  Kaypros  with  the  graphics 
capability.  All versions of BARGRAPH.COM,  whose version number is smaller 
that 2.0 may freely be copied to friends and acquaintances,  but they  must 
not  be  sold nor included in any package for sale without a prior  written

BARGRAPH  version  1.8  is  still anything but perfect,  but  it  offers  a 
limited possibility to display information as bar graphs.  Due to the large 
filesize  that SBASIC forms,  the program has some  limitations.  The  most 
notable are:
               - only 12 bars at one time
               - no printer support as yet

THE USE OF THE PROGRAM:

You start the program as any other CP//M program by writing:

BARGRAPH <return>
                    or
bargraf <return>

The  program accepts both small and capital letters IN ANY OTHER OPTION but 
when  saving of loading graphs.  Thus it is possible to use  small  letters 
almost exclusively.

The program is supposed to be very easy to use.  When you start the program 
(by writing for instance BARGRAPH and pressing<RETURN>), you will first see 
the copyright notice. Pressing any key will move onwards to the main menu.

This is what the main menu looks like:

                        M A I N   M E N U

                        (G)ive values 
                        (H)eadings  
                        (V)alue change
                        (D)raw graph  
                        (C)hange scale  
                        (S)ave graph on disk
                        (L)oad file from disk
                        (Q)UIT!
                
You  now make your choice merely by pressing the appropriate key.  You  may 
use  either small or capital letters.  DO NOT PRESS <RETURN> AFTER THE KEY! 
The basic principle in BARGRAPH is that every time a prompt is presented as 
a single letter within the brackets,  as in (G)ive values, you only have to 
press  the  letter within the brackets.  Do NOT press  <RETURN>  after  the 
letter!

The program has the following default values when it is started:

maximum bar value     = 100
bar type              = (O)pen

NOTE!  These  defaults  are  in force ONLY when the  program  is  initially 
started. Later they may be quite different.

MAIN MANU CHOICES:

(Q)UIT!! 

This choice returns you to CP/M! This choice is verified with an additional 
question.  You  must remember to save your graph BEFORE  (Q)uitting!

(G)ive values

This option enters the bar values. First you will be asked whether you wish 
to  (A)dd  more  values or (S)tart again at the  beginning.  If  you  (A)dd 
values,  the new values will be added to the previous ones (producing  more 
bars),  if you (S)tart again, the old values are destroyed. BE sure to save 
any graphs you wish before choosing this option!
Next  you will be asked the maximum value.  If you after this try to  enter 
too  large values,  the program asks you again,  thus it is not possible to 
enter values which exceed the maximum value.
The  maximum number of bars is 12.  They may be defined (O)pen by  pressing 
either  the key "A" or the key "a",  or merely <RETURN>.  In this case  you 
will see the bars' outlines.  If you press "F" or "f",  they will be filled 
bars. It is easy to accentuate the bars by defining every secong one (O)pen 
and the others (F)ull.  Usually (O)pen bars are good enough,  as the (F)ull 
bars are rather brighty.
Each  bar may be given a name (maximum 5 characters).  These names will  be 
printed below the bars.  If you enter more characters than 5, the rest will 
be truncated. After you have entered the name press <RETURN>.
After  you have given the data for one bar,  you may go on entering data by 
pressing  <RETURN>  or "Y" or "y".  If you press "N" or "n",  you  will  be 
returned to the main menu.

(H)eadings

Each  bar  grapgh  can  be given a heading (maximumn  50  characters)  This 
heading is printed on top of the graph. After you have entered the heading, 
press <RETURN>.  After the heading prints the present maximum value of  the 
bars.

(V)alue change

First  you will be asked whether you merely wish to chnage all the  present 
bars into (O)pen or (F)ull bars. Pressing <RETURN> or "N" or "n" moves onto 
the  the  next options.  This next option is also  automacitally  performed 
after you have changed all your bars (O)pen or (F)ull.
When  changing  the bar data you may change their values,  define  bars  as 
(O)pen  or  (F)ull,  and change the bar name.  As there are  only  12  bars 
possible, each bar must be gone through. Pressing <RETURN> will move to the
next bar.
NOTE! It is not possible to enter values that exceed the set maximum value. 
If you wish to enter values that are larger than the previously set maximum 
value, you must first use options (C)hange scale.

(D)raw graph

This options clears the screen and draws the present graph,  maximum value, 
possible header and bar names.  After the graph has been drawn,  the cursor 
remains on the upper left corner.  Pressing any key will return you to  the 
main menu, but all the bar data is still intact and may be changed at will.

(C)hange scale

The first set maximum scale may be freely changed, but with ONE limitation! 
It  is not possible to set a new maximum value that would be  smaller  that 
the original value of the so-far largest bar.
Thus, is your original maximum value was 10, and then you set a new maximum 
value  at  50,  enter a bar value of 23,  it is not possible to set  a  new 
maximum value smaller that 23. There is NO autoscaling!

(S)ave graph on disk

First  you will be prompted for filename.  A legal CP/M filename  will  do, 
thus  it is not possible to use small letters in filenames.  Should you try 
this  you  will  be warned.  Do NOT ADD THE  EXTENSION!  The  program  will 
automatically name your files with the extension .BGF.  If another file  by 
the same name already exists on the disk,  the previous name will be made a 
backup file with the extension .BAK.
NOTE! There is no disk directory checking from within the program, so check 
your filenames BEFORE entering BARGRAPH.

(L)oad graph from disk

This option loads a previously saved graph from disk.  The same limitations 
naturally  apply  to the filename.  Do NOT write the  EXTENSION,  only  the 
filename.
You  may  use  the  data  loaded in exactly the same  way  as  if  you  had 
originally  entered it in the program.  You may add,  change and resave the 
graph.

I  would welcome any comments.  The source will be released to  the  public 
domain as soon as the program is good enough to be improved. Future version 
should include printer support and changing the number of the bars.

I  wish  to  thank  my wife Marja,  who was the  first  (and  probably  the 
harshest) critic of the program.
