These plot files were obtained from Nick Glazzard. Here are some of his comments:

ASSY (assy.plt) (9/17/82 - US date order) — A 3D view of some single part with rear facing surfaces removed. 

IOC SOLAR DYNAMIC (icemddn_spacelab.plt) (7/20/84) — Spacelab

GROWTH KEEL (growth_keel.plt) (8/14/84) — Plan and side view of the space station.

DRAWING (drawing.plt) (1/21/82) — A pretty drawing. I think you may have this from elsewhere. Looks familiar, anyway.
