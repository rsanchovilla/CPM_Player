WELCOME TO GrafTalk
...........................................................................


GrafTalk has  been  written  to run  with a  large variety of computers and

graphics  devices.  An INSTALL step is necessary in your use of GrafTalk to

give you the freedom to choose which computer and device(s)  you  will use.

Over 1000 combinations are possible.


For the most  common combinations the  INSTALL procedure  is very simple to

use.


The next  screen will give you some hints about installing  your particular

copy of GrafTalk.

This copy of GrafTalk has been preinstalled for the Zenith computer as follows:

        COMPUTER:         Zenith

        TERMINAL:         Zenith screen

        GRAPHICS SCREEN:  Zenith screen


You can skip the INSTALL  step unless you want to  install  another graphics
device such as  a printer or plotter, or to change one of the settable para-
meters of GrafTalk.  The Zenith screen driver is pre-installed as the SCREEN
graphics device, thus you  must answer  FALSE when asked  during the INSTALL
procedure if you wish to install a SCREEN device.


If you want  to  install  another  device,  you  will  also need the INSTALL
INSTRUCTIONS and the GRAPHICS DEVICE  SHEETS.  Note that you may not install
any other graphics screen.





If you plan to install GrafTalk, be  certain that you have made a back-

up of your original disk(s)!!!!!



Please do NOT begin this procedure if you have not made backup copies.
