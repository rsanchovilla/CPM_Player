The  file  ASSIGN.SYS  contains  a list of the  device  drivers  available  to 
applications  programs during a particular session.  The program will call  up 
the  required driver by its number ( 01 - 21 ),  and the file ASSIGN.SYS gives 
the drive and file name. The default drive can be indicated by using @: rather 
than a:  or b:  You need only include the drivers you require,  but there is a 
maximum  of five entries in the file,  in descending order of size;  with  the 
default  screen  device as number 01,  the default printer  (if  required)  as 
number 11 and the default plotter (if required) as number 21.
