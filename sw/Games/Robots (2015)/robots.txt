THE GAME
--------

Robots is a turn-based game for CP/M-80 & CP/M-86.

Based on ROBOTS, a BSD game (but no source code was taken from it).

The objetive of the robots is only one: to kill you.

The only thing you can do, is to try to escape from them. But use the
teletransportation with care: you have only a few teletransport tickets!

The robots will die if they collide between them or crash against something.

That's your only opportunity to win the robots.

Good luck!
