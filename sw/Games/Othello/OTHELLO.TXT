Welcome to Othello


I just finished playing a game with no handicaps and beat this
wretched thing! But it was pretty close.

If you are just beginning, say YES when it offers you a handicap.
Take four corners. You'll need them because this program plays
a mean game.

First of all, though, a few instructions.

You have to play in such a way so that you TRAP one or more of the 
computer's tokens between one of your tokens (that you've already 
played) and the place you choose to play. The trapped tokens turn 
into your tokens after you play. You can trap on a vertical line,
a horizontal line, a diagonal, or even all three. You want to
stay away from the positions 1 space in from the edge of the
board because the edge positions are very important, especially
the corners. If you place one of your pieces near an edge, the
computer will make every attempt to put one of its pieces on
the edge.

When you begin the program you are asked a set of questions.
Answer these questions with "YES" or "NO". Use upper case
and spell out the words, otherwise the program will
make some assumptions about what you want.

For your first game, try the following to get the hang of it.

Enter "NO" to all the questions the program asks.

The program will move first and present you with a layout of
the table. The computer will be "X", you will be "O".
The computer will have four pieces, your will have one.

Take heart.

Just for starters, make the following moves, one at a time,
when it's your turn.

C6
E6
C4
F3
D8

After each move watch to see what the computer's response is.
Why did the computer move there considering the alternatives?


Good luck, I think you'll have a lot of fun with this simple
but very sophisticated game.
