GERMS     A variation on LIFE, GERMS allows you to set up an initial population
-----     of "+" and "~" germs on the screen, then watch them grow and inter-
          act.

          To move the cursor use the "L", "R", "U", and "D" keys.  Deposit
          germs with the "+" and "~" keys.  It is not necessary to capitalize
          these keys.  To remove a germ, place the cursor it over it and press
          "B".  When you are satisfied with the initial population, press "F"
          to begin.

          The rules for growth are simple.  Any occupied position lives if it
          has 2 or 3 neighbors.  It will change from "+" to "~" if it has a
          majority of "~" neighbors.  It dies of loneliness if it has 0 or 1
          neighbor and dies of overcrowding if there are 4 or more.  An empty
          position experiences a birth if it has exactly 3 neighbors.  The
          types of neighbors determine the type of birth.  ( Friendly neigh-
          borhood! )

          You may pause to examine the pattern at any time by pressing the "P"
          key.  "R" will allow growth to resume.  If you want to make changes
          in the distribution, press "C".
