   Chicken  is a two-player video game for CP/M systems that  can 
use  the same cursor addressing and clear screen codes as a  Lear 
Siegler  ADM-3A.   This  includes most Televideo  terminals,  all 
Kaypro computers, and several others.

   In  Chicken,  each player controls a 'Chicken' and attempts to 
eat seeds as they pop up on the screen.   A point is awarded  for 
each  seed eaten.   The player's chicken (which looks more like a 
snake) grows each time a seed is eaten.

   Players are not allowed to run into each other,  the walls  or 
their  own tails.   Doing any of that results in a point for  the 
other  player.   If the players collide head on,  no  points  are 
rewarded.  To earn extra points, players may use their chicken to 
corral their opponent into walls or other obstacles.

   The  players will be asked for their names and a speed  level.  
The player on the left uses the A,  D, W and X keys to turn left, 
right,  up and down,  respectively.  The player on the right uses 
the J, L, I and the comma (,) to make the same turns.

   The game may be paused at any time by pressing the space  bar.  
Any  key  restarts the game.   When a player loses a  point,  the 
computer  will ask if the game is to be continued.   Answer Y  if 
you  wish  to continue,  or N to start anew.   The  game  can  be 
cancelled   by   pressing  Control-C or ESCape  during the  game.  
Answer N for the continue question, then Y or N depending on if a 
new game or an exit to the system is desired.

   Enjoy.  Later.  Dan
