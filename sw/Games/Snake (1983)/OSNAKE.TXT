     OSNAKE is a graphic assembly program for the 
Osborne 1 computer, which was put in the public 
domain as SNAKE on Capital Osborne Users Group 
disk OUG.021. It was written by Lewis Bean, who 
wants this game to get the widest distribution 
possible. However, he has not permitted the 
release of the source code.
 
    The object of the game is to have the snake 
eat as many points as possible without  touching 
the border or "snaking back" on itself! That ends 
the game and a baby snake starts you immediately 
on a new one. The score of each game is displayed 
in the upper right corner - the highest score for 
a session is maintained in the lower right hand 
corner of the border.

     To control the movement of the snake, use the 
2,4,6 and 8 keys as arrow keys. The ESC key will 
get you back to CP/M.

     Have fun!
