                  QUBIC.DOC  VERS 3.2  10Nov85

    QUBIC is a game of tic-tac-toe in a 4x4x4 cube. The cube is
displayed in 3 dimensional form on the CRT. The Keyboard arrow keys
are used to move the cursor to your selected square within the
cube. Pressing RETURN selects that square for you and allows the
computer to make its move.

    The following files are included within the QUBIC.LBR file:

        QUBIC32.DOC = THIS FILE
        QUBIC32.PQS = TURBO PASCAL SOURCE CODE (SQUEEZED)
          (requires a 60k or > CP/M system to compile)
        QUBIC.COM = COMPILED OBJECT FOR A KAYPRO CP/M COMPUTER
          (will run on a 46K or > system, End address=0A942H)

    QUBIC is quite difficult in the "Hard game" mode but there are
many ways to win. If you log on with the name "WINNER" the computer
will select your moves for you and prove that the machine can be beat.
