COPTER

     In copter, you are a helicopter pilot dodging bombs and
destroying enemy helicopters and planes.   

There are four ways you can die.  

	1 - if you get hit by a bomb.   
	2 - if you run out of fuel.   
	3 - if you run out of bullets before getting
            the nessessary points to advance to the next level.   
	4 - if your time limit is up before you get enough points 
	    to advance to the next level.   

Planes are worth more than helicopters, and both planes and helicopters 
are worth more at higher speeds.

Only helicopters drop bombs and bombs can fall from the top of the screen.

The controls are: 

		8=Up  2=Down  6=Speed up  5=Slow down
                <ESC>=End game  {space bar}=Fire
