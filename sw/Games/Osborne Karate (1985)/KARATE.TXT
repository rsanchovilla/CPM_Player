        Karate is a graphic game where  you are a karate expert trying
to get all 26 secret  documents  and win the game.  While getting  the
documents, you must avoid fire balls, stalactites, beer cans, geysers,
falling mine rafters, and burning ash. Oh, and don't forget the guards
who are constantly trying to shoot you down with a gun.

        Before starting the game, you must do  a few preliminary steps
concerning the game font (<RET> is equal to the return key):

        Turn on the computer.
        Insert the system disk with COPYSYS.COM on it in drive A.
        Insert the disk with KARATE.COM on it in drive B.
        Press <RET>.
        Type COPYSYS <RET> at the A> prompt.
        Get the system from drive A.
        Put the system on drive B.
        Exit to CP/M.
        Take out the disk in drive A and replace it in its cover.
        Insert the system disk with CHARGEN.COM on it in drive A.
        Type CHARGEN <RET>.
        Press 2 at the main menu.
        Type B:KARATE.FNT <RET>
        After the disk drive stops press 4.
        Press 2 at the next menu.
        Press B, then 3, then 7.
        Take out the disk in drive A and replace it in its cover.
        Take out the disk in drive B and insert it in drive A.
        Reset the computer and press <RET>.
        (Note: this procedure only needs to be done once).

Now you're ready to play!  You can either type DEMO or KARATE. If this
is your first  time playing the game  type DEMO.  Typing KARATE starts
the game immediately. Typing DEMO allows you to read the instructions,
view the high scores, and see the game demo.  From DEMO you can access
KARATE and  vice-versa.  

One  point  which isn't  explained  in  the  instructions  is  playing 
KARATE  with the arrow keys.  

When playing the game press <Ctrl> Q,  which is a toggle  between  the 
arrow keys and the regular commands. When using  the arrow  keys,  the 
following commands control your man:             

                              Up - Jump    ^K
                            Down - Duck    ^J
                           Right - Right   ^L
                            Left - Left    ^H
                       Space bar - Punch

        This option wasimplemented so that if you havean  adapter
which converts the  joystick to keyboard  (such as "O 4 JOY") it would 
work on KARATE.
