I found it as part of the ZCN repository: https://github.com/jamesots/zcn

The C source has been modified for VT100 compatibility and some minor
changes have been made by me (Anna Christina Na√ü <acn@acn.wtf>.

``bs.com`` is the compiled binary.

See the ``*.txt`` files for more information.

## Modes

* ``-b`` selects a "blitz" variant
* ``-s`` selects a "salvo" variant
* ``-c`` permits ships to be placed adjacently

The "blitz" variant allows a side to shoot for as long as
it continues to score hits.

The "salvo" game allows a player one  shot  per  turn  for
each  of his/her ships still afloat.  This puts a premium
scoring hits early and knocking out some ships   and  also
makes  much harder the situation where you face a superior
force with only your PT-boat.

## Keys

To position your ships: move the cursor to a spot, then type the first letter of a ship 
(using CAPITAL letters) type to select it, then type a direction ([hjkl] or [4862]),
indicating how the ship should be pointed.
You may also type a ship letter followed by `r' to position it randomly, or type `R' to
place all remaining ships randomly.

Navigation and aiming keys:

| r     | place this ship randomly | R         | place all ships randomly |
| ^L    | screen redraw            | Q         | quit game                |

## Compiling

HiTech C has been used to compile it, but it needs a lot of free memory (TPA).

For compiling, I used the command ``c bs.c`` in CP/M.
