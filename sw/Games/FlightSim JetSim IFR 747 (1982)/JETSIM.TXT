1. OVERVIEW:                                                         

   The JETSIM.BAS AND JETSIMB.BAS programs simulates the Take-off,                    
Flight, and Landing of a Boeing 747 Airplane flying IFR.                                

   JETSIM.BAS/JETSIMB.BAS is a CP/M version, Written in MBASIC by 
Robert A. Feldman (CFOG), of JETSET.BAS, written by Eugene Szymanski 
and published in BYTE magazine, November 1982.
   You should consult the original article for additional data and 
instructions (especially drawings illustrating the ILS system). 

                                                                      
2. FILES: "TAKE-OFF", "FLIGHT" & "LANDING:

 a) JETSIM.BAS is the Take-off module 
 b) JETSIMB.BAS is the Flight and Landing module.
   Running JETSIM.BAS will automatically load and run JETSIMB.BAS
(which must be in drive B: on a seperate disk to Autoload) if the 
"Take-off" was successful. However, it is not necessary to start
with JETSIM.BAS: as all variables are reinitialized to set values.
   Thus, after you can sucessfuly take off, you can skip the take 
off proceedures, which are fairly simple and routine, and get on 
to the more dificult and interesting parts. 
                                                                     
3. SETTING-UP, LOADING AND RUNNING:  
                                   
 a) Copy the file JETSIMB.BAS to a 2nd disk, to be used in Drive B.
 b) Place your MBASIC Disk in Drive A.
 c) Load MBASIC by typing
         MBASIC <cr>
 d) After it loads, you will have an "OK" Prompt. Remove the MBASIC 
    Disk from Drive A.
 e) Place the Disk with JETSIM.BAS in Drive A and the Disk with 
    JETSIMB.BAS in Drive B.
 f) Set the ALPHA-LOCK key "On"and leave it "On".                    
    (MBASIC Requires all entries to in CAPS)
 g) Start the Flight by typing
     RUN "JETSIM.BAS"<cr>    NOTE: Use the " " MARKS AS SHOWN.
 h) The screen display is designed for 80 columns, but it is 
possible to use a 52 character screen (which makes landing a 
bit more difficult, while scrolling the screen).

4. TAKE-OFF OVERVIEW:                                          
                                                                     
   The take-off is from Philadelphia, and landing can be 
made at JFK, Boston, Buffalo, Philadelphia, Philipsburgh PA, 
and Sault Ste. Marie MI (?!).
   There are 16 VOR navigation stations (the VP and VF arrays in the 
listing) but only 6 landing sites (the VG array) of a possible 16 
are included at present.
   Additional landing parameters can be added for the remaining 10 
sites by filling in the VG array. VG(X,0) is the initial approach 
radial and VG(X,1) the runway localizer direction. For JFK, these 
values are 238 (the reciprocal of the 58 degree VOR setting) and 28 
(the localizer direction or landing heading).

5. TAKE-OFF PROCEDURES:

   A set sequence of key responses is required for a successful take 
off. The sequence is:
 L (Lower Flaps)
 B (Brakes Release)
 F (Full Throttle).

   After the Brakes are Released, (using B) the air speed will 
slowly increase, as a result of the engine's idle thrust.
   After Full Throttle is applied, (using F),the air speed will 
increase and runway markings will move down-screen.
   During take-off, winds can blow the jet off course, so rudder 
corrections, using the < or > keys will be needed to keep the 
airplane position marker (the dot at the bottom of the screen) 
centered.   NOTE: THESE <  > KEYS ARE NOT THE ARROW KEYS! 









FILE...: JETSIM.DOC (cont'd)                                               

   When your Ground-speed reaches 150 kts, press the DOWN Arrow-key 
once to lift-off the runway. This will take place near the end of 
the runway.
   NOTE: Critical Proceedure:

   After lift-off, but before 1200 feet altitude, you must get the:

 Wheels Raised, W Key (to got the wheels out of the airstream and                         
                        reduce drag)    
 Flaps Raised,  L Key (to change flaps from Down or Take Off (max 
                       lift) to Up position, less drag for speed)
 Slow Throttle, S Key (to cut the throttle because of noise abate-
                       ment laws when flying over Cities)
 At 1900 feet, the screen will clear and you will be asked if you 
want to speed up the simulation when the jet is above 5000 feet. 
After answering, the full instrument panel will be displayed.

                                                                      
6. CROSS-COUNTRY FLYING:
                                              
   You will be flying under IFR (Instrument Flight Rules), 
using your compass and VOR indicator.
a) TUNING THE VOR RADIO STATIONS
   First press V to tune in a VOR station (115.9 for JFK), then R
to set a VOR radial (the reciprocal of a heading out from the VOR 
station, 58 for JFK). North is 0, east 90, etc. The maximum VOR 
distance is 300 nm.(NAUTICAL MILES, Which is 1.3 Miles)
   Once this is done, the RANGE will say TO and DME (Distance 
Measuring Equipment) will change to show the distance to the VOR 
station.
   The ^ marker on the VOR RADIAL dial will deflect, showing 
which direction the rudder needs to be shifted towards. Maintain 
your 75 degree take-off heading until 3000 feet, then (for JFK) 
swing north to about 24. The ^ will move toward the center as you 
are getting closer to the radial. When it is centered, swing the 
rudder to bring the compass to agree with the VOR radial. 
  The flight should be uneventful, except that winds will begin 
blowing the jet off course, so rudder adjustments will be needed.
  If you are unsure where you are in relation to the VOR station, 
press A, and the RADIAL will automatically "rotate" to the radial 
you are on.
  During the flight, the rudder keys, < and >,  change the heading 
by 1 degree for the first press, 10 degrees for the second, 20 for 
the third, etc. Pressing / will snap the rudder back to center.
  The pitch controls (DOWN and UP arrows) change the pitch by 5 
degrees for each press. The RIGHT arrow brings the pitch to 0 (level 
flight).
  To fly long distances, you go from one VOR station to another. Set 
the first VOR frequency and radial (ideally those specified by the 
FAA as jet routes, but these were not listed in the article). Fly 
towards it until DME nears 15-20 nm. Then tune in the next VOR and 
enter the new radial. When the radial needle centers, steer to the 
new heading.

FILE...: JETSIM.DOC (cont'd)                                               

  If you fly on the radial towards the VOR station, DME will reach 0 
nm when you are directly over the "transmitter." At this point, the 
DME will begin to increase and the RANGE will change from TO to 
FROM.
  The RANGE indicator will display OUT if no station is tuned in, an 
incorrect frequency has been tuned, or you are more than 300 nm from 
the transmitter.
                                 
7. LANDING:

   Begin landing procedures as follows:
                                                   
a) At 38 nm from destination, start descent to about 1800 feet. 
b) At 20 nm, slow to 300 kts, (S Key) which reduces the Throttles,
             lower the wheels,(W Key) 
             lower the flaps, (L Key)
        These will drop the air speed to 120 kts.
c) At 12 nm, the MARKER light should go on. This means that the jet    
has come to the ILS Outer Marker. You must quickly steer to the    
runway localizer direction (28 for JFK). This must be done within    
about 15 or 20 seconds, or you will fly out of the "ILS cone." If    
the turn is successful, the RADAR ALT will display a reading and    
the ILS display will begin to change. At this point pitch down 3    
degrees (3 presses of UP arrow, which only changes 1 degree for    
each press during landing).

d) At this point, fly using the 2 ILS needles (lines of +'s).
   The vertical needle gives the horizontal position of the jet in 
the ILS cone. Your position is the O, so if the needle moves left of 
center, you are right of the proper course and must use the < to 
turn left. 
   However, unlike during flying, each press of < or > moves the 
heading only one degree, so to swing from 28 to 20, you need to 
press < 8 times, coordinating with the screen refresh (and loops 
through the key poll subroutine).
   The horizontal ILS needle shows your position in relation to the 
correct descent glide slope. If the O is above the line, you are not 
descending fast enough.
   At 600 feet, a landing runway display will appear in the lower 
right corner of the screen. It shows your relation, side-to-side, to 
the runway. Steer using this display, not the ILS. Things will 
happen fast now (landing is the most difficult part of a real 
flight).
   When the RADAR ALT reads 200 feet, you pass over the Middle 
Marker, and the MARKER lamp will come on again. This is the go/no-go 
point. If you are not lined up for a safe landing, press M, the 
Missed Approach key.







FILE...: JETSIM.DOC (cont'd)                                               
   Doing this ends the program run with a "You done right" message. 
I recommend not pressing M, and seeing where you crash, if you are 
unable to steer onto the runway in time.
   At 100 feet, cut the throttle by pressing S.
   At 50 feet, press the RIGHT arrow, which shifts the pitch to +1 
degree.
   The result is that the jet stalls (the STALL light comes on), and 
settles to the runway (if everything has been done properly).
   When RADAR ALT indicates 0, press Q, reversing the thrust, and 
wait while the air speed drops to 0. At this point, the display will 
clear and your landing stats will be displayed.
  If you crash, or land improperly, the appropriate message will be 
displayed.
