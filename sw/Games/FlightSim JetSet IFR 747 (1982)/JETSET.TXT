 	JETSET.DOC	747 FLIGHT SIMULATOR  (JETSET)

         This program  was originally written up in the November,
1982 issue of BYTE magazine under the title JETSET.  The
documentation that follows is MODIFIED excerpts  from  the 
complete documentation found in that magazine.  Also, there 
are  drawings  that  cannot  be reproduced.

         With the JET Simulator Electronic Trainer (hence
JETSET), you'll maneuver  an  aircraft  through  the  three 
stages  of flight - takeoff, cruising, and landing - in less 
than  ideal  conditions.   The  program, originally  written  for
the TRS-80 and modified for the IBM-PC,DEC Robin, and now Kaypro,
uses the keyboard and screen to make a personal computer version
of  a  commercial flight simulator.  You and the controls, of
course, remain firmly planted on  the  ground.   JETSET  is 
flown according to Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). NOTE: KAYPRO
USES TYPICAL X+32,Y+32 CURSOR ADD. CHR$(31) IS SOLID BLOCK.
	Listed below are the keyboard keys, functions, and definitions:

         The  following  procedures  will  allow  you to takeoff from the
Philadelphia airport and, hopefully, land at the  Buffalo  airport.    To
get  a  more detailed description of how this simulator works, see note later
in this writeup.

	TAKEOFF PROCEDURE
	------- ---------
	A.	Lower flaps (L key).
	B.	Apply full throttle (F key).
	C.	Release brakes (B key).
	D.	Steer along the 075-degree runway using the left/right rudder
		keys (< and >).  Coordinate steering with the COMPASS reading
		and the position of the arrow located at the base of the
		runway graphic.
	E.	As soon as the AIRSPEED indicates 150 knots, press the U key
		once to gently lift the jet off the runway.
	F.	After the horizon line drops below the screen,  press the W
		key to raise the landing gear.
	G.	Retract the flaps (L key).
	H.	Throttle back the engines (S key).
	I.	Sit back and relax for a minute or so as the jet gains
		altitude.

	PRACTICE FLIGHT
	-------- ------
	A.	Execute the takeoff form Philadelphia as described above.
	B.	Level off at 10,000 feet.
	C.	Steer approximately north.
	D.	Adjust airspeed to 600 knots.
	E.	Tune to the frequency of the Buffalo VOR station (116.4 MHz).
	F.	Input the value of 295-degrees radial into the receiver.
	G.	When the VOR needle moves to center, alter course to
		295-degrees (COMPASS).
	H.	Now steer to keep the VOR needle centered.  This indicator,
		not the compass, will provide exact guidance for the
		remainder of the flight.
	I.	Use the DME indicator to keep track of the distance
		remaining, in nautical miles, to Buffalo.  To estimate the
		remaining flying time (in minutes), simply divide the DME
		reading by 10.
	J.	When the DME readout reaches zero, the jet has arrived.

	INSTRUMENT LANDING    Alternate Route to Buffalo
	---------- -------
	A.	Execute the takeoff procedures.
	B.	Continue to climb to an altitude of 3000 feet on a course of
		075 degrees.
	C.	At 3000 feet, alter course to 000 degrees and continue
		climbing. Adjust thrust for airspeed of 600 knots.  Tune VOR
		to Philipsburg station (115.5 MHz), and set radial to 278
		degrees.
	D.	Steer along 278-degree radial when intercepted.  Level off at
		40,000 feet and proceed to Philipsburg at 600 knots.
	E.	At DME=20 NM, retune VOR to Buffalo (116.4 MHz) and set
		radial to 346 degrees.
	F.	Upon intercepting the 346-degree radial, alter course to
		follow the radial to Buffalo.
	G.	At DME=73 NM, begin decent to 1900 feet (descend at
		approximately 11,000 FPM).
	H.	Level off at 1900 feet.  Remain aligned with the radial.
	I.	Begin initial approach trim when DME=20 NM as follows:
		1.  Reduce airspeed to 300 knots (S key).
		2.  Drop landing gear (W key).
		3.  Lower the flaps (L key).
		4.  Adjust altitude to between 1700 and 1900 feet (elevator
			keys).
		5.  Keep the VOR needle centered (rudder keys) to stay on
                    the initial approach radial.

	J.	Be alert for the flash of the MARKER (which occurs when
		the DME=12).  At this signal the jet must be maneuvered for
		the  final approach:
		1.  Quickly swing the nose until the compass shows 042 degrees.		2.  Use rudder and elevator keys to keep the ILS indicator
		    needles centered as the jet descends along the
		    glidepath.
		3.  As soon as the runway graphic appears on the screen,
                    use the graphic arrow as a guide to apply rudder
		    corrections.

	K.  When the MARKER lamp flashes again to announce arrival at the
            decision - height point, check the runway alignment using the
            graphic  displayed  on the screen.  If necessary, press the M
            (Missed  Approach)  key  to  abort   the   landing   attempt.
            Otherwise,  if  the  plane  is lined up safely, take all cues
            from the RADAR ALT from here on in:

		1.	At 100 feet, idle the engines (S key).
		2.	At 50 feet, flare up the nose (C key).
		3.	At  0 feet, the jet is on the runway.  Slow it down by
			applying reverse thrust to the engines (Q key).

	Your  JETSET  flight  concludes  with  a  display  of the landing
	information that tells you how well you handled  the  jet.   This
	information specifies where ground contact occurred and where the
	jet  finally  rolled  to  a  halt.   If you made a mistake at the
	middle  marker,  the  landing   report   will   print   out   the
	consequences.

	This  is  only  a  small  part  of the capabilities of the JETSET
	simulator.  There are about 15 to 20  additional  airports  built
	in.   It  is  conceivable  that you could fly all over the United
	States.  Remember though, this simulator is flown real-time !! If
	it  takes  6 hours to fly from New York to San Fransico in a real
	aircraft, it will take you the same 6 hours flying the simulator.

	worth), send $2.00 to cover copying and postage,  and  your  name

1.   After  takeoff,  continue	climbing  to 6000 feet on course
075 degrees. While climbing, tune VOR to JFK station (115.9 Mhz)
and set radial to  058 degrees.

align with it, and proceed toward Long Island, New York at 400
knots.

3.  At DME = 38 NM, begin descent to 1900 feet (descend at
approximately 7410 FPM).

4.  Level off at 1900 feet.  Remain aligned with radial.

5.  Begin initial approach trim when DME = 20 NM.

6.    Execute  ILS  final  approach  procedures  when  MARKER 
lamp  flashes. Localizer direction is 028 degrees.
