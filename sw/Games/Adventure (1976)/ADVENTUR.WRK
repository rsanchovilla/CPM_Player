THE SOUTH AND WEST.$YOU ARE IN AN ALCOVE. A SMALL NW PATH SEEMS TO WIDEN AFTER
A SHORT DISTANCE.  AN EXTREMELY TIGHT TUNNEL LEADS EAST.
IT LOOKS LIKE A VERY TIGHT SQUEEZE. AN EERIE LIGHT CAN BE

THE FLOOR IS COVERED BY WHITE MIST SEEPING IN FROM
THE NORTH.  THE WALLS EXTEND UPWARD FOR WELL OVER 100
FEET.  SUSPENDED FROM SOME UNSEEN POINT FAR ABOVE YOU,
AN ENORMOUS TWO-SIDED MIRROR IS HANGING PARALLEL TO AND
MIDWAY BETWEEN THE CANYON WALLS.  (THE MIRROR IS
OBVIOUSLY PROVIDED FOR THE USE OF THE DWARVES,
WHO AS YOU KNOW, ARE EXTREMELY VAIN.)  A SMALL WINDOW
CAN BE SEEN IN EITHER WALL, SOME FIFTY FEET UP.$YOU'RE AT A LOW WINDOW OVERLOOKING A HUGE PIT, WHICH
EXTENDS UP OUT OF SIGHT.  A FLOOR IS INDISTINCTLY
VISIBLE OVER 50 FEET BELOW.  TRACES OF WHITE MIST

THERE IS A SIMILAR WINDOW LOOKING INTO A LIGHTED ROOM.
A SHADOWY FIGURE CAN BE SEEN THERE PEERING BACK AT YOU.$A LARGE STALACTITE EXTENDS FROM THE ROOF AND ALMOST
REACHES THE FLOOR BELOW.  YOU COULD CLIMB DOWN IT,
AND JUMP FROM IT TO THE FLOOR, BUT HAVING DONE SO
YOU WOULD BE UNABLE TO REACH IT TO CLIMB BACK UP.$YOU ARE IN A LITTLE MAZE OF TWISTING PASSAGES,
ALL DIFFERENT.$YOU ARE AT THE EDGE OF A LARGE UNDERGROUND RESERVOIR.
AN OPAQUE CLOUD OF WHITE MIST FILLS THE ROOM AND RISES
RAPIDLY UPWARD.  THE LAKE IS FED BY A STREAM, WHICH 
TUMBLES OUT OF A HOLE IN THE WALL ABOUT 10 FEET
OVERHEAD AND SPLASHES NOISILY INTO THE WATER SOMEWHERE
WITHIN THE MIST.  THE ONLY PASSAGE GOES BACK TOWARD THE
SOUTH.$DEAD END$YOU ARE AT THE NORTHEAST END OF AN IMMENSE ROOM, EVEN
LARGER THAN THE GIANT ROOM.  IT APPEARS TO BE A
REPOSITORY FOR THE "ADVENTURE" PROGRAM.  MASSIVE TORCHES
FAR OVERHEAD BATHE THE ROOM WITH SMOKEY YELLOW LIGHT.
SCATTERED ABOUT YOU CAN BE SEEN A PILE OF BOTTLES (ALL
EMPTY), A NURSERY OF YOUNG BEANSTALKS MURMURING QUIETLY,
A BED OF OYSTERS, A BUNDLE OF BLACK RODS WITH RUSTY STARS
ON THEIR ENDS,AND A COLLECTION OF BRASS LANTERNS.  OFF
TO ONE SIDE A GREAT MANY DWARVES ARE SLEEPING ON THE 
FLOOR, SNORING LOUDLY.  A SIGN NEARBY READS: "DO NOT
DISTURB THE DWARVES!" AN IMMENSE MIRROR IS HANGING
AGAINST ONE WALL, AND STRETCHES TO THE OTHER END OF THE
ROOM, WHERE VARIOUS OTHER SUNDRY OBJECTS CAN BE GLIMPSED
DIMLY IN THE DISTANCE.$YOU ARE AT THE SOUTHWEST END OF THE REPOSITORY.  TO ONE
SIDE IS A PIT FULL OF FIERCE GREEN SNAKES.  ON THE OTHER
SIDE IS A ROW OF SMALL WICKER CAGES, EACH OF WHICH
CONTAINS A LITTLE SULKING BIRD.  IN ONE CORNER IS A
BUNDLE OF BLACK RODS WITH RUSTY MARKS ON THEIR ENDS.  A
LARGE NUMBER OF VELVET PILLOWS ARE SCATTERED ABOUT ON THE
FLOOR.  A VAST MIRROR STRETCHES OFF TO THE NORTHEAST.  AT
YOUR FEET IS A LARGE STEEL GRATE, NEXT TO WHICH IS A SIGN
WHICH READS, "TREASURE VAULT. KEYS IN MAIN OFFICE."$YOU ARE ON ONE SIDE OF A LARGE, DEEP CHASM.

NOISE CAN BE HEARD IN THE DISTANCE.$THE PATH FORKS HERE.  THE LEFT FORK LEADS NORTHEAST.
A DULL RUMBLING SEEMS TO GET LOUDER IN THAT DIRECTION.
THE RIGHT FORK LEADS SOUTHEAST DOWN A GENTLE SLOPE. 
THE MAIN CORRIDOR ENTERS FROM THE WEST.$THE WALLS ARE QUITE WARM HERE.  FROM THE NORTH CAN BE
HEARD A STEADY ROAR, SO LOUD THAT THE ENTIRE CAVE SEEMS
TO BE TREMBLING. ANOTHER PASSAGE LEADS SOUTH, AND A
LOW CRAWLWAY GOES EAST.$YOU ARE ON THE EDGE OF A BREATH-TAKING VIEW.  FAR BELOW
YOU IS AN ACTIVE VOLCANO, FROM WHICH GREAT GOUTS OF
MOLTEN LAVA COME SURGING OUT, CASCADING BACK DOWN INTO
THE DEPTHS.  THE GLOWING ROCK FILLS THE FARTHEST
REACHES OF THE CAVERN WITH A BLOOD-RED GLARE, GIVING
EVERY-THING AN EERIE, MACABRE APPEARANCE.  THE AIR IS
FILLED WITH FLICKERING SPARKS OF ASH AND A HEAVY SMELL
OF BRIMSTONE.  THE WALLS ARE HOT TO THE TOUCH, AND THE
THUNDERING OF THE VOLCANO DROWNS OUT ALL OTHER SOUNDS.
EMBEDDED IN THE JAGGED ROOF FAR OVERHEAD ARE MYRIAD
TWISTED FORMATIONS COMPOSED OF PURE WHITE ALABASTER,
WHICH SCATTER THE MURKY LIGHT INTO SINISTER APPARITIONS
UPON THE WALLS.  TO ONE SIDE IS A DEEP GORGE, FILLED
WITH A BIZARRE CHAOS OF TORTURED ROCK WHICH SEEMS TO
HAVE BEEN CRAFTED BY THE DEVIL HIMSELF.  AN IMMENSE RIVER
OF FIRE CRASHES OUT FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE VOLCANO,
BURNS ITS WAY THROUGH THE GORGE, AND PLUMMETS INTO A
BOTTOMLESS PIT FAR OFF TO YOUR LEFT.  TO THE RIGHT,
AN IMMENSE GEYSER OF BLISTERING STEAM ERUPTS CONTINUOUSLY
FROM A BARREN ISLAND IN THE CENTER OF A SULFUROUS LAKE,
WHICH BUBBLES OMINOUSLY.  THE FAR RIGHT WALL IS AFLAME
WITH AN INCANDESCENCE OF ITS OWN, WHICH LENDS AN
AN ADDITIONAL INFERNAL SPLENDOR TO THE ALREADY
HELLISH SCENE. A DARK, FOREBODING PASSAGE EXITS TO THE
SOUTH.$YOU ARE IN A SMALL CHAMBER FILLED WITH LARGE BOULDERS.
THE WALLS ARE VERY WARM, CAUSING THE AIR IN THE ROOM
TO BE ALMOST STIFLING FROM THE HEAT.  THE ONLY EXIT IS
A CRAWLWAY HEADING WEST, THROUGH WHICH IS COMING
A LOW RUMBLING.$YOU ARE WALKING ALONG A GENTLY SLOPING NORTH/SOUTH
PASSAGE LINED WITH ODDLY SHAPED LIMESTONE FORMATIONS.$YOU ARE STANDING AT THE ENTRANCE TO A LARGE, BARREN ROOM.

FALL INTO A PIT.$IF YOU PREFER, SIMPLY TYPE W RATHER THAN WEST.$ARE YOU TRYING TO CATCH THE BIRD?$THE BIRD IS FRIGHTENED RIGHT NOW AND YOU CANNOT CATCH
IT NO MATTER WHAT YOU TRY.  PERHAPS YOU MIGHT TRY LATER.$ARE YOU TRYING TO SOMEHOW DEAL WITH THE SNAKE?$YOU CAN'T KILL THE SNAKE, OR DRIVE IT AWAY, OR AVOID IT,
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.  THERE IS A WAY TO GET BY,
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE THE NECESSARY RESOURCES RIGHT NOW.$DO YOU REALLY WANT TO QUIT NOW?$YOU FELL INTO A PIT AND BROKE EVERY BONE IN YOUR BODY!$YOU ARE ALREADY CARRYING IT.$YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!$THE BIRD WAS UNAFRAID WHEN YOU ENTERED, BUT AS YOU
APPROACH IT BECOMES DISTURBED AND YOU CANNOT CATCH IT.$YOU CAN CATCH THE BIRD, BUT YOU CANNOT CARRY IT.$THERE IS NOTHING HERE WITH A LOCK!$YOU AREN'T CARRYING IT!$THE LITTLE BIRD ATTACKS THE GREEN SNAKE, AND IN AN
ASTOUNDING FLURRY DRIVES THE SNAKE AWAY.$YOU HAVE NO KEYS!$IT HAS NO LOCK.$I DON'T KNOW HOW TO LOCK OR UNLOCK SUCH A THING.$IT WAS ALREADY LOCKED.$THE GRATE IS NOW LOCKED.$THE GRATE IS NOW UNLOCKED.$IT WAS ALREADY UNLOCKED.$YOU HAVE NO SOURCE OF LIGHT.$YOUR LAMP IS NOW ON.$YOUR LAMP IS NOW OFF.$THERE IS NO WAY TO GET PAST THE BEAR TO UNLOCK
THE CHAIN, WHICH IS PROBABLY JUST AS WELL.$NOTHING HAPPENS$WHERE?$THERE IS NOTHING HERE TO ATTACK.$THE LITTLE BIRD IS NOW DEAD.  ITS BODY DISAPPEARS.$ATTACKING THE SNAKE BOTH DOESN'T WORK AND IS VERY
DANGEROUS.$YOU KILLED A LITTLE DWARF.$YOU ATTACK A LITTLE DWARF, BUT HE DODGES OUT OF THE WAY.$WITH WHAT?  YOUR BARE HANDS?$GOOD TRY, BUT THAT IS AN OLD WORN-OUT MAGIC WORD.$I KNOW OF PLACES, ACTIONS, AND THINGS. MOST OF MY
VOCABULARY DESCRIBES PLACES AND IS USED TO MOVE YOU
THERE.  TO MOVE, TRY WORDS LIKE FOREST, BUILDING,
DOWNSTREAM, ENTER, EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH, UP,
OR DOWN.  I KNOW ABOUT A FEW SPECIAL OBJECTS, LIKE
A BLACK ROD HIDDEN IN THE CAVE.  THESE OBJECTS CAN BE
MANIPULATED USING SOME OF THE ACTION WORDS THAT I KNOW. 
USUALLY YOU WILL NEED TO GIVE BOTH THE OBJECT AND ACTION
WORDS (IN EITHER ORDER), BUT SOMETIMES I CAN INFER THE
OBJECT FROM THE VERB ALONE.  SOME OBJECTS ALSO IMPLY
VERBS; IN PARTICULAR, "INVENTORY" IMPLIES
"TAKE INVENTORY", WHICH CAUSES ME TO GIVE YOU A LIST
OF WHAT YOU'RE CARRYING.  THE OBJECTS HAVE SIDE
EFFECTS: FOR INSTANCE, THE ROD SCARES THE BIRD.
USUALLY PEOPLE HAVING TROUBLE MOVING JUST NEED TO TRY
A FEW MORE WORDS.  USUALLY PEOPLE TRYING UNSUCCESSFULLY
TO MANIPULATE AN OBJECT ARE ATTEMPTING SOMETHING
BEYOND THEIR (OR MY!) CAPABILITIES AND SHOULD TRY
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TACK.  TO SPEED THE GAME YOU
CAN SOMETIMES MOVE LONG DISTANCES WITH A SINGLE WORD.
FOR EXAMPLE, "BUILDING" USUALLY GETS YOU TO THE BUILDING
FROM ANYWHERE ABOVE GROUND EXCEPT WHEN LOST IN THE
FOREST.  ALSO, NOTE THAT CAVE PASSAGES TURN A LOT,
AND THAT LEAVING A ROOM TO THE NORTH DOES NOT GUARANTEE
ENTERING THE NEXT FROM THE SOUTH.
GOOD LUCK!$IT MISSES!$IT GETS YOU!$OK$YOU CAN'T UNLOCK THE KEYS.$YOU HAVE CRAWLED AROUND IN SOME LITTLE HOLES AND WOUND
UP BACK IN THE MAIN PASSAGE.$I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE CAVE IS, BUT HEREABOUTS NO STREAM
CAN RUN ON THE SURFACE FOR LONG.  I WOULD TRY THE STREAM.$I NEED MORE DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS TO DO THAT.$I CAN ONLY TELL YOU WHAT YOU SEE AS YOU MOVE ABOUT AND
MANIPULATE THINGS.  I CANNOT TELL YOU WHERE REMOTE
THINGS ARE.$I DON'T KNOW THAT WORD.$WHAT?$ARE YOU TRYING TO GET INTO THE CAVE?$THE GRATE IS VERY SOLID AND HAS A HARDENED STEEL LOCK.
YOU CANNOT ENTER WITHOUT A KEY, AND THERE ARE NO KEYS
NEARBY.  I WOULD RECOMMEND LOOKING ELSEWHERE FOR THE KEYS.$THE TREES OF THE FOREST ARE LARGE HARDWOOD OAK AND MAPLE,
WITH AN OCCASIONAL GROVE OF PINE OR SPRUCE.  THERE IS
QUITE A BIT OF UNDERGROWTH, LARGELY BIRCH AND ASH
SAPLINGS PLUS NONDESCRIPT BUSHES OF VARIOUS SORTS.
THIS TIME OF YEAR VISIBILITY IS QUITE RESTRICTED BY
ALL THE LEAVES, BUT TRAVEL IS QUITE EASY IF YOU DETOUR
AROUND THE SPRUCE AND BERRY BUSHES.$WELCOME TO ADVENTURE!!  WOULD YOU LIKE INSTRUCTIONS?$DIGGING WITHOUT A SHOVEL IS QUITE IMPRACTICAL.
EVEN WITH A SHOVEL PROGRESS IS UNLIKELY.$BLASTING REQUIRES DYNAMITE.$I'M AS CONFUSED AS YOU ARE.$MIST IS A WHITE VAPOR, USUALLY WATER, SEEN FROM TIME TO
TIME IN CAVERNS.  IT CAN BE FOUND ANYWHERE, BUT IS
FREQUENTLY A SIGN OF A DEEP PIT LEADING DOWN TO WATER.$YOUR FEET ARE NOW WET.$I THINK I JUST LOST MY APPETITE.$THANK YOU, IT WAS DELICIOUS!$YOU HAVE TAKEN A DRINK FROM THE STREAM.  THE WATER TASTES
STRONGLY OF MINERALS, BUT IS NOT UNPLEASANT.  IT IS 
EXTREMELY COLD.$THE BOTTLE OF WATER IS NOW EMPTY.$RUBBING THE ELECTRIC LAMP IS NOT PARTICULARLY REWARDING.
ANYWAY, NOTHING EXCITING HAPPENS.$PECULIAR.  NOTHING UNEXPECTED HAPPENS.$YOUR BOTTLE IS EMPTY AND THE GROUND IS WET.$YOU CAN'T POUR THAT.$NONE OF THAT, NOW!$WHICH WAY?$OH DEAR, YOU SEEM TO HAVE GOTTEN YOURSELF KILLED.
I MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP YOU OUT, BUT I'VE NEVER REALLY
DONE THIS BEFORE.  DO YOU WANT ME TO TRY TO REINCARNATE
YOU?  ALL RIGHT.  BUT DON'T BLAME ME IF SOMETHING
GOES WR......$                    --- POOF!! ---
YOU ARE ENGULFED IN A CLOUD OF ORANGE SMOKE.
COUGHING AND GASPING, YOU EMERGE FROM THE SMOKE AND
FIND....$YOU CLUMSY OAF, YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN! I DON'T KNOW HOW
LONG I CAN KEEP THIS UP.  DO YOU WANT ME TO TRY
REINCARNATING YOU AGAIN?$OKAY, NOW WHERE DID I PUT MY ORANGE SMOKE?.... >POOF!<
EVERYTHING DISAPPEARS IN A DENSE CLOUD OF ORANGE SMOKE.$NOW YOU'VE REALLY DONE IT!  I'M OUT OF ORANGE SMOKE!
YOU DON'T EXPECT ME TO DO A DECENT REINCARNATION WITHOUT
ANY ORANGE SMOKE, DO YOU?$OKAY, IF YOU'RE SO SMART, DO IT YOURSELF!  I'M LEAVING!$>>> MESSAGES 81 THRU 90 ARE RESERVED FOR "OBITUARIES".<<<$SORRY, BUT I NO LONGER SEEM TO REMEMBER HOW IT WAS YOU

OFJUMPING.$THERE IS NO WAY ACROSS THE FISSURE.$YOU'RE NOT CARRYING ANYTHING.$YOU ARE CURRENTLY HOLDING THE FOLLOWING:$IT'S NOT HUNGRY (IT'S MERELY PININ' FOR THE FJORDS).
BESIDES, YOU HAVE NO BIRD SEED.$THE SNAKE HAS NOW DEVOURED YOUR BIRD.$THERE'S NOTHING HERE IT WANTS TO EAT (EXCEPT PERHAPS
YOU)!$YOU FOOL, DWARVES EAT ONLY COAL!  NOW YOU'VE MADE HIM
*REALLY* MAD!!$YOU HAVE NOTHING IN WHICH TO CARRY IT.$YOUR BOTTLE IS ALREADY FULL.$THERE IS NOTHING HERE WITH WHICH TO FILL THE BOTTLE.$YOUR BOTTLE IS NOW FULL OF WATER.$YOUR BOTTLE IS NOW FULL OF OIL.$YOU CAN'T FILL THAT.$DON'T BE REDICULOUS!$THE DOOR IS EXTREMELY RUSTY AND REFUSES TO OPEN.$THE PLANT INDIGNANTLY SHAKES THE OIL OFF ITS LEAVES
AND ASKS, "WATER?"$THE HINGES ARE QUITE THOROUGHLY RUSTED NOW AND WON'T
BUDGE.$THE OIL HAS FREED UP THE HINGES SO THAT THE DOOR WILL
NOW MOVE, ALTHOUGH IT REQUIRES SOME EFFORT.$THE PLANT HAS EXCEPTIONALLY DEEP ROOTS AND CANNOT BE
PULLED FREE.$THE DWARVES' KNIVES VANISH AS THEY STRIKE THE WALLS OF
THE CAVE.$SOMETHING YOU'RE CARRYING WON'T FIT THROUGH THE TUNNEL
WITH YOU. YOU'D BEST TAKE INVENTORY AND DROP SOMETHING.$YOU CAN'T FIT THIS FIVE-FOOT CLAM THROUGH THAT LITTLE
PASSAGE!$YOU CAN'T FIT THIS FIVE-FOOT OYSTER THROUGH THAT LITTLE
PASSAGE!$I ADVISE YOU TO PUT DOWN THE CLAM BEFORE OPENING IT.
 >STRAIN!<$I ADVISE YOU TO PUT DOWN THE OYSTER BEFORE OPENING IT.
>WRENCH!<$YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING STRONG ENOUGH TO OPEN THE CLAM.$YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING STRONG ENOUGH TO OPEN THE OYSTER.$A GLISTENING PEARL FALLS OUT OF THE CLAM AND ROLLS AWAY.
GOODNESS THIS MUST REALLY BE AN OYSTER.  (I NEVER WAS
VERY GOOD AT IDENTIFYING BIVALVES.)  WHATEVER IT IS,
IT HAS NOW SNAPPED SHUT AGAIN.$THE OYSTER CREAKS OPEN, REVEALING NOTHING BUT OYSTER 
INSIDE.  IT PROMPTLY SNAPS SHUT AGAIN.$YOU HAVE CRAWLED AROUND IN SOME LITTLE HOLES AND FOUND
YOUR WAY BLOCKED BY A RECENT CAVE-IN.  YOU ARE NOW BACK
IN THE MAIN PASSAGE.$THERE ARE FAINT RUSTLING NOISES FROM THE DARKNESS BEHIND
YOU.$OUT FROM THE SHADOWS BEHIND YOU POUNCES A BEARDED PIRATE!
"HAR, HAR," HE CHORTLES, "I'LL JUST TAKE ALL THIS BOOTY
AND HIDE IT AWAY WITH ME CHEST DEEP IN THE MAZE!"
HE SNATCHES YOUR TREASURE AND VANISHES INTO THE GLOOM.$A SEPULCHRAL VOICE REVERBERATING"THROUGH THE CAVE, SAYS,
"CAVE CLOSING SOON.  ALL ADVENTURERS EXIT IMMEDIATELY
THROUGH MAIN OFFICE."$A MYSTERIOUS RECORDED VOICE GROANS INTO LIFE AND
ANNOUNCES:"THIS EXIT IS CLOSED.  PLEASE LEAVE VIA
MAIN OFFICE."$IT LOOKS AS THOUGH YOU'RE DEAD.  WELL, SEEING AS HOW
IT'S SO CLOSE TO CLOSING TIME ANYWAY, I THINK WE'LL
JUST CALL IT A DAY.$THE SEPULCHRAL VOICE ENTONES, "THE CAVE IS NOW CLOSED."
AS THE ECHOES FADE, THERE IS A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT
(AND A SMALL PUFF OF ORANGE SMOKE). . . .
AS YOUR EYES REFOCUS, YOU LOOK AROUND AND FIND...$THERE IS A LOUD EXPLOSION, AND A TWENTY-FOOT HOLE APPEARS
IN THE FAR WALL, BURYING THE DWARVES IN THE RUBBLE.
YOU MARCH THROUGH THE HOLE AND FIND YOURSELF IN THE MAIN
OFFICE, WHERE A CHEERING BAND OF FRIENDLY ELVES CARRY THE
CONQUERING ADVENTURER OFF INTO THE SUNSET.$THERE IS A LOUD EXPLOSION, AND A TWENTY-FOOT HOLE APPEARS
IN THE FAR WALL, BURYING THE SNAKES IN THE RUBBLE. 
A RIVER OF MOLTEN LAVA POURS IN THROUGH THE HOLE,
DESTROYING EVERYTHING IN ITS PATH, INCLUDING YOU!$THERE IS A LOUD EXPLOSION, AND YOU ARE SUDDENLY SPLASHED
ACROSS THE WALLS OF THE ROOM.$THE RESULTING RUCKUS HAS AWAKENED THE DWARVES. 
THERE ARE NOW SEVERAL THREATENING LITTLE DWARVES IN
THE ROOM WITH YOU!  MOST OF THEM THROW KNIVES AT YOU!
ALL OF THEM GET YOU!$OH, LEAVE THE POOR UNHAPPY BIRD ALONE.$I DARESAY WHATEVER YOU WANT IS AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.$I DON'T KNOW THE WORD "STOP".
USE "QUIT" IF YOU WANT TO GIVE UP.$YOU CAN'T GET THERE FROM HERE.$YOU ARE BEING FOLLOWED BY A VERY LARGE, TAME BEAR.$IF YOU WANT TO END YOR ADVENTURE EARLY, SAY "QUIT".
TO SUSPEND YOUR ADVENTURE SUCH THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE
LATER, SAY "SUSPEND" (OR "PAUSE" OR "SAVE").
TO SEE WHAT HOURS THE CAVE IS NORMALLY OPEN, SAY "HOURS".
TO SEE HOW WELL YOU'RE DOING, SAY "SCORE".  TO GET FULL
CREDIT FOR A TREASURE, YOU MUST HAVE LEFT IT SAFELY IN
THE BUILDING, THOUGH YOU GET PARTIAL CREDIT JUST FOR
LOCATING IT.  YOU LOSE POINTS FOR GETTING KILLED,
OR FOR QUITTING, THOUGH THE FORMER COSTS YOU MORE.
THERE ARE ALSO POINTS BASED ON HOW MUCH (IF ANY) OF
THE CAVE YOU'VE MANAGED TO EXPLORE; IN PARTICULAR,
THERE IS A LARGE BONUS JUST FOR GETTING IN
(TO DISTINGUISH THE BEGINNERS FROM THE REST OF THE PACK),
AND THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOU'VE BEEN
THROUGH SOME OF THE MORE HARROWING SECTIONS.
IF YOU THINK YOU'VE FOUND ALL THE TREASURES, JUST
KEEP EXPLORING FOR A WHILE.  IF NOTHING INTERESTING
HAPPENS, YOU HAVEN'T FOUND THEM ALL YET.  IF SOMETHING
INTERESTING *DOES* HAPPEN, IT MEANS YOU'RE GETTING A
BONUS AND HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GARNER MANY MORE POINTS
IN THE MASTER'S SECTION.  I MAY OCCASIONALLY OFFER HINTS
IF YOU SEEM TO BE HAVING TROUBLE.  IF I DO, I'LL WARN YOU
IN ADVANCE HOW MUCH IT WILL AFFECT YOUR SCORE TO ACCEPT
THE HINTS.  FINALLY, TO SAVE PAPER, YOU MAY SPECIFY 
"BRIEF", WHICH TELLS ME NEVER TO REPEAT THE FULL
DESCRIPTION OF A PLACE UNLESS YOU EXPLICITLY ASK ME TO.$DO YOU INDEED WISH TO QUIT NOW?$THERE IS NOTHING HERE WITH WHICH TO FILL THE VASE.$THE SUDDEN CHANGE IN TEMPERATURE HAS DELICATELY SHATTERED
THE VASE.$IT IS BEYOND YOUR POWER TO DO THAT.$I DON'T KNOW HOW.$IT IS TOO FAR UP FOR YOU TO REACH.$YOU KILLED A LITTLE DWARF.  THE BODY VANISHES IN A CLOUD
OF GREASY BLACK SMOKE.$THE SHELL IS VERY STRONG AND IS IMPERVIOUS TO ATTACK.$WHAT'S THE MATTER, CAN'T YOU READ?  NOW YOU'D BEST START
OVER.$THE AXE BOUNCES HARMLESSLY OFF THE DRAGON'S THICK SCALES.$THE DRAGON LOOKS RATHER NASTY.  YOU'D BEST NOT TRY TO GET
BY.$THE LITTLE BIRD ATTACKS THE GREEN DRAGON, AND IN AN
ASTOUNDING FLURRY GETS BURNT TO A CINDER.
THE ASHES BLOW AWAY.$ON WHAT?$OKAY, FROM NOW ON I'LL ONLY DESCRIBE A PLACE IN FULL THE
FIRST TIME
YOU COME TO IT.  TO GET THE FULL DESCRIPTION, SAY "LOOK"$TROLLS ARE CLOSE RELATIVES WITH THE ROCKS AND HAVE SKIN
AS TOUGH AS THAT OF A RHINOCEROS.  THE TROLL FENDS OFF
YOUR BLOWS EFFORTLESSLY.$THE TROLL DEFTLY CATCHES THE AXE, EXAMINES IT CAREFULLY,
AND TOSSES IT BACK, DECLARING, "GOOD WORKMANSHIP,
BUT IT'S NOT VALUABLE ENOUGH."$THE TROLL CATCHES YOUR TREASURE AND SCURRIES AWAY OUT OF
SIGHT.$THE TROLL REFUSES TO LET YOU CROSS.$THERE IS NO LONGER ANY WAY ACROSS THE CHASM.$JUST AS YOU REACH THE OTHER SIDE, THE BRIDGE BUCKLES
BENEATH THE WEIGHT OF THE BEAR, WHICH WAS STILL FOLLOWING
YOU AROUND.  YOU SCRABBLE DESPERATELY FOR SUPPORT,
BUT AS THE BRIDGE COLLAPSES, YOU STUMBLE BACK AND FALL
INTO THE CHASM.$THE BEAR LUMBERS TOWARD THE TROLL, WHO LETS OUT A
STARTLED SHRIEK AND SCURRIES AWAY.  THE BEAR SOON GIVES
UP THE PURSUIT AND WANDERS BACK.$THE AXE MISSES AND LANDS NEAR THE BEAR WHERE YOU CAN'T
GET AT IT.$WITH WHAT?  YOUR BARE HANDS?  AGAINST *HIS* BEAR HANDS??$THE BEAR IS CONFUSED; HE ONLY WANTS TO BE YOUR FRIEND.$FOR CRYING OUT LOUD, THE POOR THING IS ALREADY DEAD!$THE BEAR EAGERLY WOLFS DOWN YOUR FOOD, AFTER WHICH HE
SEEMS TO CALM DOWN CONSIDERABLY AND EVEN BECOMES RATHER
FRIENDLY.$THE BEAR IS STILL CHAINED TO THE WALL.$THE CHAIN IS STILL LOCKED.$THE CHAIN IS NOW UNLOCKED.$THE CHAIN IS NOW LOCKED.$THERE IS NOTHING HERE TO WHICH THE CHAIN CAN BE LOCKED.$THERE IS NOTHING HERE TO EAT.$DO YOU WANT THE HINT?$DO YOU NEED HELP GETTING OUT OF THE MAZE?$YOU CAN MAKE THE PASSAGES LOOK LESS ALIKE BY DROPPING
THINGS.$ARE YOU TRYING TO EXPLORE BEYOND THE PLOVER ROOM?$THERE IS A WAY TO EXPLORE THAT REGION WITHOUT HAVING
TO WORRY ABOUT FALLING INTO A PIT.  NONE OF THE OBJECTS
AVAILABLE IS IMMEDIATELY USEFUL IN DISCOVERING THE
SECRET$DO YOU NEED HELP GETTING OUT OF HERE?$DON'T GO WEST.$GLUTTONY IS NOT ONE OF THE TROLL'S VICES.
AVARICE IS, HOWEVER.$YOUR LAMP IS GETTING DIM.  YOU'D BEST START WRAPPING
THIS UP, UNLESS YOU CAN FIND SOME FRESH BATTERIES.
I SEEM TO RECALL THERE'S A VENDING MACHINE IN THE MAZE.
BRING SOME COINS WITH YOU.$YOUR LAMP HAS RUN OUT OF POWER.$THERE'S NOT MUCH POINT IN WANDERING AROUND OUT HERE,
AND YOU CAN'T EXPLORE THE CAVE WITHOUT A LAMP.
SO LET'S JUST CALL IT A DAY.$THERE ARE FAINT RUSTLING NOISES FROM THE DARKNESS BEHIND
YOU.  AS YOU TURN TOWARD THEM, THE BEAM OF YOUR LAMP
FALLS ACROSS A BEARDED PIRATE. HE IS CARRYING A LARGE
CHEST.  "SHIVER ME TIMBERS!" HE CRIES, "I'VE
BEEN SPOTTED!  I'D BEST HIE MESELF OFF TO THE MAZE TO
HIDE ME CHEST!" WITH THAT, HE VANISHES INTO THE GLOOM.$YOUR LAMP IS GETTING DIM.  YOU'D BEST GO BACK FOR THOSE
BATTERIES.$YOUR LAMP IS GETTING DIM.  I'M TAKING THE
LIBERTY OF REPLACING THE BATTERIES.$YOUR LAMP IS GETTING DIM, AND YOU'RE OUT OF SPARE
BATTERIES.  YOU'D BEST START WRAPPING THIS UP.$I'M AFRAID THE MAGAZINE IS WRITTEN IN DWARVISH.$"THIS IS NOT THE MAZE WHERE THE PIRATE LEAVES HIS
TREASURE CHEST."$HMMM, THIS LOOKS LIKE A CLUE, WHICH MEANS IT'LL COST
YOU 10 POINTS TO READ IT.  SHOULD I GO AHEAD AND
READ IT ANYWAY?$IT SAYS, "THERE IS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT THIS PLACE,
SUCH THAT ONE OF THE WORDS I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN
NOW HAS A NEW EFFECT."$IT SAYS THE SAME THING IT DID BEFORE.$I'M AFRAID I DON'T UNDERSTAND.$"CONGRATULATIONS ON BRINGING LIGHT INTO THE DARK-ROOM!"$YOU STRIKE THE MIRROR A RESOUNDING BLOW, WHEREUPON IT
