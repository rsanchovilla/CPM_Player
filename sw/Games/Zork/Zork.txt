
The  object  of zork is to get as many points as  possible  while 
exploring the territory.   Points are obtained by placing objects 
in  the  trophy  case which is in the living room of  the  house.  
Points are also obtained by killing the beasts encountered.  Most 
verbs can be used in the game as commands.  For example:

   TAKE    PICK UP    GO SOUTH    GO NORTH     DOWN
   UP      CLIMP      DROP        OPEN         MOVE

Also the directions can be specified by single letters:

   N S E W  NE NW SW SE  etc.

It  is  a good idea to pick up anything you  can  (i.e.  lanterns 
ropes etc.) on your journey as you'll never know when you'll need 
one.

The house is the most important place to get into as it will  get 
you  the most points.   Anytime an object is mentioned (such as a 
rug) you should MOVE it to see what is in it as this will get you 
more points.  Happy hunting!
