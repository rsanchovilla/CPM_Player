OTHELLO   This program takes advantage of the video capabilities of the 84
-------   model Kaypros to display a very nice board but be warned:  the
          program will not run properly on pre 84 Kaypros.  ( Pre 84 models
          have neither graphics nor inverse video. )  The file BOARD.MQC
          contains an assembly language program which handles I/O and
          graphics.

          OTHELLO is played on an 8X8 board.  The computer's pieces may be
          captured by surrounding them (in a line) with your own.  For
          example, A "0" played below has the effect shown.


                   X                X                X
                  X000    --->    0X000    --->    00000
                  X                X                X


          Any play which does not surround opposing pieces is illegal.  The
          object of the game is to finish with more pieces than the computer.

          The computer will ask if you want to go first, then if you want to
          be given a handicap.  A handicap consists of starting the game with
          one or more corners in your possession.  Corners give a distinct
          advantage, as they cannot be surrounded and taken.  If you don't
          take a handicap, the computer asks if it can take one.

          Whoever plays first uses the solid pieces.  The other player uses
          the empty pieces.  After you have identified a square (A1, D7, etc.),
          one of your pieces will be placed at that location on the board.  To
          stop the game at any time, press the escape key.
