     This  Othello game originally came fron the public domain as 
"OTHELLO.FOR".  I  have  taken  all  the  READ,  WRITE  &  FORMAT 
statements  out  and written an Assembly  Language  program  that 
contains  all  the  console I/O along with routines  to  use  the 
graphics on the Kaypro 10 and 4-84 to display the game board.

     No  instructions are needed to play the game other then  the 
prompts  that  appear as the game goes on.  I have  included  one 
thing that isn't documented,  if the ESCAPE key is pressed at any 
input prompt the game will end.  The reason for this is because I 
have  used  the CP/M function 6 for all the I/O and that  is  the 
only  WAY  you can end the game before the end,  short of a  cold 
boot.

     Please  note  that this "COM" program as supplied will  only 
work properly on Kaypro machines that support the graphics.
