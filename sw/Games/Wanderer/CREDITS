                            WANDERER CREDITS
                           ==================

This file should always be available to all players of the game. Feel free to
add anything necessary, eg, if you create some new screens, but don't *delete*
anything! -Steven Shipway

        Wanderer was created by Steven Shipway, a first year mathematics
student at Warwick University, England.  The idea came from games such as
Boulderdash, Xor, and especially Repton, from Superior Software.

        Later improvements came from play@nl.cwi, who designed the editor
and made countless bugfixes, of which there are too many to list here. He
also improved many parts of the original code, and also designed some
screens. Also Dave (david@ist.co.uk), who did most of the work towards the
improved level jumping routine (sorry, I had to alter it a bit due to other
changes). Jason (jason@uucp.aeras) is responsible for the help routine, for
which I am eternally grateful since it saved me a lot of work.

        Assisting in the development were Rob McMahon (our systems manager)
and Mark Sunnarks. In screen development were the following:

Screens 1,2,3,4,7,8,10,16  Steven Shipway (although some of them are AWFUL)
Screens 5,6             James Beckett  (far more evil than mine)
Screen  9               Kenton Oatley  (also the late (bugged) screen no.13)
Screens 11,13,14,19,20  play@nl.cwi    (who wishes to remain nameless to avoid
                                        the netherlands mafia :-)
Screen  17              david@ist.co.uk  (sorry, I dont know your full name)
Screen  15              Bruce Butterfield (from Down Under)
Screen  18              Alex Butterfield  (yes they are relations. age 10)

[[ Any new screens you wish to have added to the list please mail to me for ]]
[[ release in a official update package. The address is                     ]]
[[ {maujp,csupt}@uk.ac.warwick.cu or ...!mcvax!ukc!warwick!{maujp,csupt}.   ]]
[[ SEE NOTE AT BOTTOM OF FILE   DG                                          ]]

The official PC Port for Wanderer was done by Greg Margo, who may be found at
gmago@uucp.netxcom or uunet!netxcom!gmargo. He is also responsible for the
save/restore game feature, so any bugs in that are *his* fault :-)

The X-Windows port - which is pretty impressive - comes from Mike Cuddy.
His address is cuddy%convex@edu.umich.cc.umix or ihnp4!convex!cuddy. Although
I haven't been able to see this one for myself a friend assures me that the
graphics are fantastic.

Also thanks to Paul Metcalf for thinking of a name for the game!
(fame for you at last, Paul!)

N.B. This file contains the original wanderer Credits, but a few changes
will be necessary. For those who can't send Internet / UUCP E-mail,
instead of trying to reach Steven directly, send your screens to me
(Delta G) and I'll make sure they reach Steven. Please also add your
real name, so that you can be immortalised in subsequent credits files.
