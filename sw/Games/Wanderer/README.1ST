			WANDERER
			========

As delivered this will run on any Televideo compatible screen,
including Commodore C128 in CP/M mode; Wyse 50's; Wyse 60's;
Kaypro's; Liberty Freedom 110's, 200's and Turbo 1's; ADM3A;
and ADM31. I've included a file QTERM.PAT that talks a lot
about patching other stuff. You will see that the patch area
is a lot bigger than it needs to be, but that is because it
uses the same patch overlay as QTERM, ROGUE, etc. The two
patches needed to make WANDERER go are: clear screen and moveto.
I'd suggest just putting those two in, and setting the terminal
capability byte to zero, to nuke out everything else. ALSO NOTE
the save command will be:

A>SAVE 36 WANDERER.COM

as wanderer is a bit smaller than QTERM.


I have included all the screens that have been released so far: 1 - 49.
SCREEN.050 is present, but only contains a single period: '.' This is
to tell wanderer that after screen 49 there aren't any more. However,
if you try to jump to (say) screen 76, it won't detect the overrun, and
you'll get a rather unpleasant message from wanderer. Oh well .....


If you have any questions, suggestions, flames, comments, bug reports
or screens to be released, I can be reached at:
