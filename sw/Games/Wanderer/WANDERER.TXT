Wanderer.

The idea of the game is to wander around the screen picking up diamonds,
and when you have them all, exit. However there are a few things to make
life difficult. Here is a list of what you will see in the play area.

@		You.
= #		Impassable rock.
!		Landmines - these explode if you move on top of them.
/ \		Deflectors - boulders, arrows and balloons slide off these.
O		Boulders - these will fall down when their support is
		removed. They kill you if they land on you.
< >		Speeding Arrows - These run left or right as appropriate,
		and will slide off boulders, just like they do off deflectors.
		These also kill you when they hit you.
^		Balloons - these go up, they are also popped if hit by
		speeding arrows. They do not kill you if they hit you.
*		Diamonds - these are what you are after - score 10 points.
:		Passable earth - goes away when you dig through it - score
		1 point.
T		Teleport - Moves you somewhere else, and scores 20 points when
		you use it.
X		The way out - you can't get out unless you have got all the
		diamonds - score 250 for a successful escape
C		Time capsule - on some screens where moves are limited these
		give you 250 extra moves, and scores 5 points.
M		Big monster - always chases you. It can be killed by falling
		boulders, or speeding arrows, but not by balloons. Scores 100
		when you kill him.
S		Small monster - these run round things, but if they run
		into you they will eat you. They can be caught in .....
+		Cages. These catch one Small monster each, and turn into
		diamonds, and score 20 points


To move around use H J K L (H left, J down, K up, L right)
To quit, use Q
There is a screen jump facility built in, to jump to any screen, type ~
and the number of the screen you want to jump to


In addition there is a screen editor built into wanderer. This allows
you to create your own screens. Just say

A>WANDERER -E

and you are in the editor. The motion keys will move you around (HJKL),
typing other letters (as shown in the instructions) will place that
item at the current cursor location. Other commands are:

Q		Quits editing session, and save current changes. While
		a screen is being edited, it is kept in a file SCREEN,
		this command writes the screen out to SCREEN, and returns
		to CP/M.

P		Play the current screen. This first writes the screen to
		file SCREEN, and then enters normal play mode so you can
		test the screen.

V		Alter the number of moves for the screen. To allow unlimited
		moves, enter zero.

A note about screens:

In the rightmost column of screens, you may see '-' characters. These are
translated to spaces for playing, and are necessary because certain
editors have a tendancy to trim trailing spaces from text files being
edited. It would be best to leave these as is, because if someone else
ever goes to work on your screen with such an editor, and the '-'s are
NOT there, then the screen will get broken.
