Run DEMON.COM to get a demo of the FPL program.  You will need to reboot
to exit the demo.
 
The first time that you run FPL, it will come up in Install mode and you
will have the opportunity to describe the characteristics of your computer
to the program.  Each time after that you run FPL, it will come up as you
have configured it.  To change that configuration, you must erase (delete)
the file CONFIG.FPL which can be done from the CP/M prompt or from the
menu when in FPL.
 
The demo should provide enough information to start using the program.
You may want to have the demo print to your printer so that you can refer
to the information while in FPL.
