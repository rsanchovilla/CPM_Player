                QS, a spread sheet for CP/M features:

                26col x 99row sheet
                variable col width
                "WordStar" type editing functions / movement,
                algabric formula evaluation (nested cell refs. allowed)
                trigimetric functions,
                column / row summation functions.



                             Instructions:

    First: in QS press </> for help, this will bring up a screen with
           all of the commands/options.

  Positioning to desired cell.
use:
           <^S>-rgt     <^D>-lft     <^E>-up     <^X>-dn
           <^A>-pg rgt  <^F>-pg lft  <^R>-pg up  <^C>-pg dn

  To enter text into a cell press the <`> key and type "what ever" then <RET>.
use:       ^S to move left
           ^D to move right
           ^V to toggle insert/overwrite mode
           ^G to delete right
        <DEL> to delete left

  Graphic cell entery functions the same as text but graphic symbols are
shown in place of text. (that is on H19 terminals but you may be able
to use this on your system. If you have TP look in the file QSMISC and
the note on compiling at the end of this file!)

  To enter a formula depress the <=> key then type the formula followed
by the format suffix and <RET>. Output formats include hidden (HIDE),
floating (FD), dollar (DOL), scientific (SCI), and bar-graph (BAR).
The FD and DOL formats can have optional floating $ or trailing % / #.
And all formats (except BAR) can be left/right/center justifyed.
for example:

 <=>
 sin(45)&sci>
 <RET>
This will cause the cell to show the value of the sine of 45 degrees.
The format of output is scientific-right-justifyed.

 <=>
 100&dol$<
 <RET>
This will show the value $100. The format is dollar-$-right-justifyed.

 <=>
 60&dol$^
 <RET>
This will show the value $100. The format is dollar-$-centered.

 <=>
 10&bar
 <RET>
This will display ##########.

 <=>
 A1
 <RET>
This will show the value of cell A1.
The format is defalt (dollar-right-justifyed).

 <=>
 SUM[A1>A10]
 <RET>
This will show the value of cells A1 through A10 added.
The format is defalt (dollar-right-justifyed).


  Also various numeric functions are available: In QS type </> for help and
you will get a list of them.


                                 NOTES:
                Since version 1 I have made some changes:

   Corrected a 'bug' that caused stray numbers to be printed (they were
   really h19 control chars for cursor on/off and block/underline that
   I forgot to disable. Sorry for the trash!).
   And another bug that kept the  DOL$<  FD$<  formats from from working.
   Help is now on disk to save memory (free space now up 5k from v1.0).

   Also:
     If you have Turbo Pascal (I use Version 2) make sure you set the
   end address of the options menu to '97FF'.  This saves about 5k of memory
   for the recursion stack.
