        CHALK  AN ELECTRONIC SPREADSHEET



        1. OVERVIEW:
           CHALK  IS AN ELECTRONIC SPREADSHEET.  IT ALLOWS YOU TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN  A 
           BOARD OF TABULAR DATA.  SOME POSSIBLE USES ARE CASH FLOW PROJECTION, STUDENT 
           GRADE BOOK, PHONE BOOK, INVENTORY MAINTENANCE, CHECK BOOK MAINTENANCE, AND SALES 
           HISTORY.

           A BOARD IS A TABLE HAVING ROWS AND COLUMNS. THE BOARD HAS A TITLE. EACH ROW
           AND EACH COLUMN MAY HAVE A TITLE. THE INTERSECTION OF A ROW AND A COLUMN IS
           CALLED A CELL.  CELLS ARE THE BASIC BUILDING BLOCK OF THE BOARD. EACH CELL
           CONTAINS AN AMOUNT AND A FORMULA. NORMALLY AMOUNTS ARE DISPLAYED BUT YOU
           CAN ALTERNATLY SEE FORMULAS.

           YOU CONTROL ALL TITLES AND THE CONTENTS OF ALL CELLS. YOU CAN SAVE AND
           RETRIEVE THE CONTENTS OF ANY BOARD AS A FILE. SELECTED AMOUNTS OF EXISTING
           BOARDS CAN BE MERGED WITH THE CURRENT BOARD. ROWS AND COLUMNS CAN BE ADDED
           OR DELETED. SELECTED PORTIONS OF THE BOARD CAN BE SORTED BY ROW TITLE OR
           ROW AMOUNT IN ASCENDING OR DESCENDING SEQUENCE. THE BOARD CAN BE PRINTED.

        2. GET STARTED:
           THIS SECTION EXPLAINS THE STEPS NECESSARY TO START USING A BOARD. IT ASSUMES 
           THAT THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN DEFINED.

        AN EMPTY BOARD OF 3 ROWS BY 4 COLUMNS WILL BE CONSTRUCTED. NOTE THAT FOR THIS
        EXAMPLE THE BOARD COULD EVENTUALLY GROW TO 22 ROWS BY 23 COLUMNS. IT IS
        IMPORTANT THAT YOU ESTIMATE AS ACCURATLY AS POSSIBLE THE DIMENSIONS OF YOUR
        BOARD. EACH TIME YOU RUN CHALK AND SPECIFY A NEW OR EXISTING BOARD, THE
        MAXIMUM BOARD SIZE WILL BE COMPUTED. CHALK ATTEMPTS TO ALLOCATE AN EQUAL
        NUMBER OF ROWS AND COLUMNS BEYOND THE CURRENT BOARD SIZE. THAT IS A ROW WILL
        BE ALLOCATED AND THEN A COLUMN REPETITIVELY UNTIL ALL AVAILABLE MEMORY IS
        USED. THUS SHOULD YOU ADD ROWS BEYOND THE INITIAL 3 AND THEN SAVE THE BOARD,
        THE NEXT TIME YOU RUN CHALK WITH THIS BOARD, MAX ROWS WILL PROBABLY BE LARGER
        AND MAX COLUMNS WILL BE SMALLER.

           A BOARD IS A TABLE HAVING ROWS AND COLUMNS. THE BOARD HAS A TITLE. EACH ROW
           AND EACH COLUMN MAY HAVE A TITLE. THE INTERSECTION OF A ROW AND A COLUMN IS
           CALLED A CELL.  CELLS ARE THE BASIC BUILDING BLOCK OF THE BOARD. EACH CELL
           CONTAINS AN AMOUNT AND A FORMULA. NORMALLY AMOUNTS ARE DISPLAYED BUT YOU
           CAN ALTERNATLY SEE FORMULAS.

           YOU CONTROL ALL TITLES AND THE CONTENTS OF ALL CELLS. YOU CAN SAVE AND
           RETRIEVE THE CONTENTS OF ANY BOARD AS A FILE. SELECTED AMOUNTS OF EXISTING
           BOARDS CAN BE MERGED WITH THE CURRENT BOARD. ROWS AND COLUMNS CAN BE ADDED
           OR DELETED. SELECTED PORTIONS OF THE BOARD CAN BE SORTED BY ROW TITLE OR
           ROW AMOUNT IN ASCENDING OR DESCENDING SEQUENCE.

        3.1 BOARD COMMUNICATION:
            THE FIRST THREE LINES OF THE CRT ARE USED TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE BOARD.

        3.1.1 LINE 1. HEADER INFORMATION:
            LINE ONE DISPLAYS THE LOCATION OF THE CURRENT CELL (WHICH IS HIGHLIGHTED
            ON THE DISPLAY), THE BOARD FILE NAME, COPYRIGHT, AUTOMATIC CURSOR
            DIRECTION, AND THE FORMULA OF THE CURRENT CELL. IF CALCULATIONS MUST BE
            PERFORMED TO UPDATE THE BOARD, A WARNING IS DISPLAYED ON THE LINE.

        3.1.2 LINE 2. DATA ENTRY PROMPT:
            LINE TWO DISPLAYS THE CURRENT ROW AND COLUMN TITLES. COMMANDS, AMOUNTS
            AND FORMULAS ARE INPUT, THE CURSOR ADVANCES AND THE BOARD IS REFRESHED.
            COMMAND PROMPTS ARE ALSO DISPLAYED ON THIS LINE.

        3.1.3 LINE 3. WARNINGS AND MESSAGES PERTINENT TO THE LAST DATA ENTRY.


        3.2 BOARD DATA:
        3.2.1  LINE 4. BOARD TITLE AND DATE.
        3.2.2  LINE 5. COLUMN IDENTIFIERS.
        3.2.3  LINE 6. COLUMN TITLES.

            5. CHALK.CTL
            6. CHALKNEW.COM
            THESE ARE THE ONLY FILES THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED TO EXECUTE CHALK.
            CHALKNEW.COM IS ONLY NEEDED WHEN RECONFIGURING THE SYSTEM.

        7.3 TAILOR CHALK TO YOUR SYSTEM CONFIGURATION:
            EXECUTE CHALKNEW TO MODIFY THE FOLLOWING FIELDS IN CRT.CTL:
            1. SCREEN DEPTH.
            2. SCREEN WIDTH.
            3. PRINTER PAGE LINES.
            4. PRINTER PAGE WIDTH.
            5. HOME. THIS IS THE COMMAND TO HOME THE CURSOR ONLY. DON'T USE THE
               COMMAND TO HOME AND CLEAR.

            NOTE THAT ITEMS 5 THRU 10 EXPECT THE DECIMAL VALUES OF THE ASCII CHARACTER
            CODES NEEDED TO FORM THAT COMMAND. IF MORE THAN ONE ASCII CHARACTER IS
            NEEDED, THEY MUST BE SEPARATED BY COMMAS. FOR EXAMPLE THE HAZLETINE 1500
            COMMAND TO HOME THE CURSOR IS '126,18'. SEE THE CONTROL FILE IF YOU NEED

        8.   BOARD DESIGN HINTS:
             LOOK FOR AN EXISTING BOARD SIMILAR TO THE BOARD YOU WANT AND COPY IT.
             IF YOU CAN'T FIND AN EXISTING BOARD TO COPY THEN DO THE FOLLOWING.

        8.1  ESTIMATE  THE  NUMBER  OF ROWS AND COLUMNS YOU  WILL  NEED.  THIS  IS 
             IMPORTANT AS IT IS TIME CONSUMING TO ADD OR DELETE ROWS AND COLUMNS.

        8.2  TITLE THE BOARD.

        8.3  TITLE ROWS.

        8.4  TITLE COLUMNS.

        8.5  DEFINE FORMULAS.
             IF  YOU ARE SUMMING A SERIES OF CELLS IT IS HELPFUL TO MAKE THE FIRST CELL 
             OF  THE SERIES BLANK.  SINCE BLANK CELLS ALWAYS CONTAIN A VALUE  OF  ZERO, 
             THIS  DOESN'T  AFFECT THE CALCULATIONS YET MAKES IT MUCH EASIER TO ADD  OR 
             DELETE THE FIRST CELL CONTAINING DATA.

             REMEMBER THAT CALCULATIONS ARE ALWAYS PERFORMED FROM TOP TO BOTTOM LEFT TO 
             RIGHT.

        8.6  ENTER INITIAL AMOUNTS.

                  MAY BE SAVED AS MANY TIMES AS DESIRED FOR ANY CHALK SESSION.

               CELL:
                  THE BASIC BUILDING BLOCKS OF THE BOARD. THE CURRENT CELL IS
                  HIGHLIGHTED. EACH CELL CONTAINS AN AMOUNT AND A FORMULA. UNLESS YOU 
                  ARE  IN  FORMULA MODE YOU WILL SEE AN ENTERED AMOUNT OR A CALCULATED 
                  AMOUNT IN EACH CELL. CELLS ARE ADDRESSED BY ROW AND COLUMN.

               COLUMN:
                  EACH CELL OCCUPIES A COLUMN ADDRESS. COLUMNS ADDRESSES ARE 2
                  ALPHABETIC CHARACTERS.

               FORMULA:
                  THE ALGORITHM USED TO DISPLAY THE COMPUTED AMOUNT FOR ANY  CELL. SEE 
                  THE HELP SCREENS FOR MORE ABOUT FORMULAE.

               TITLE:
                  YOU CAN TITLE A BOARD.
                  YOU CAN ALSO TITLE EACH ROW AND EACH COLUMN.

        10.  MESSAGES:
               MESSAGES APPEAR  ON  THE THIRD LINE OF THE SCREEN.  THEY  DESCRIBE  THE 
               RESULTS OF THE LAST ENTERED DATA.  IF AN ERROR HAS BEEN MADE  THE  BELL
