        1. CHKPHONE   NAMES, BIRTHDATES AND PHONES.
           THIS  IS A PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD EXAMPLE.
           TRY SORTING THIS A FEW TIMES BY NAME, BIRTHDATE OR PHONE.
           NOTICE HOW THE DATA IS ARRANGED TO FACILITATE EASE OF SORTING.
           
        2. CHKCASH    IT MIGHT HELP YOUR CASHFLOW.
           THIS  IS  THE LARGEST EXAMPLE.  LOOK AT HOW '&' WAS USED TO  FIGURE  QUARTER 
           AMOUNTS AND THEN '+' TO FIGURE HALF YEAR AMOUNTS.
           NOTICE HOW THE BEGINNING BALANCE IS CARRIED FORWARD FROM THE END BALANCE.
           CAN  YOU  SEE HOW USING A '%' STATE SALES FIGURE ENABLES THIS  TO  BECOME  A 
           USEFUL TOOL FOR FORECASTING?
           WILSON  PAYS  TITHING  ON  HIS TITH SO THAT GETS FIGURED IN  AFTER  THE  NET 
           PERIOD.
           NOTICE  HOW  THE REVENUE '&' REFERENCES THE BLANK ROW PRIOR  TO  THE  ACTUAL 
           DATA.  THIS ALLOWS FOR THE INSERTION OF ADDITIONAL LINES AT THE BEGINNING OF 
           THIS SECTION. EXPENSE WORKS THE SAME WAY.

        3. CHKCHECK   TRY IT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO MAINTAIN CHECKS ON A COMPUTER.
           IT MIGHT HELP YOUR BUDGET. YOU COULD MAKE UP ONE OF THESE FOR EACH OF THE 12 
           MONTHS OF THE YEAR AND ALSO MAKE UP ONE FOR YEAR TO DATE WHICH HAS ONLY  ONE 
           LINE ON IT FOR EACH MONTH.  THEN AFTER EACH MONTH IS COMPLETE. LOAD THE YEAR 
           TO  DATE  AND ADD BOARD THE TOTAL LINE OF THE LAST MONTH TO THE  SAME  MONTH 
           THUS GIVING YOU A CUMULATIVE SET OF COSTS.

        4. CHKCLASS   USEFUL FOR TEACHERS TRACKING STUDENT SCORES.
           THIS  ONE GETS PRETTY FANCY.  NOTICE HOW THE FORMULA FOR POSSIBLE POINTS HAD 
           TO  BE OVERRIDDEN FOR GEORGE GRICE AND NEW STUDENT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T  TAKE 
           ALL  TESTS.  IT  ALSO NECESSARY TO INPUT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS  TAKING  ANY 
           TEST.  SINCE THERE IS A MAXIMUM OF 99 ROWS ON CHALK, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY SET 
           UP A SEPARATE SHEET FOR EACH CLASS SECTION.

        5. CHKMETER   WHATS HAPPENING TO THE UTILITY BILL.  
           TOO BAD MOST UTILITIES NOW HAVE GRADUATED RATES.  STILL YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO 
           ADAPT THIS TO GASOLINE OR SOMETHING?

        6. CHKSALES   SALES MANAGERS WILL LOVE THIS.
           FOR  EACH  SALESMAN IT SHOWS THE NAME,  PHONE NUMBER,  12 MONTH HISTORY  AND 
           CURRENT MONTH HISTORY. 
           THIS BOARD WOULD BE MAINTAINED AS FOLLOWS:
           1.  MAKE  A MASTER WITH NAMES,  PHONES AND MONTHLY HISTORY THRU LAST  MONTH. 
           LEAVE THE CURRENT MONTH AND ALL 31 DAYS AS ZERO.
           2. SAVE THE MASTER.
           3. SAVE A WORK COPY FOR THE CURRENT MONTH.
           4. DAILY POST SALES TO THE WORK COPY.
           5.  AT  THE END OF THE MONTH ADD BOARD THE MONTHLY TOTAL COLUMN OF THE  WORK 
           COPY  TO  THE  CURRENT  MONTH OF THE MASTER.  BE  SURE  YOU  DON'T  DO  THIS 
           BACKWARDS.  BE  ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT BOTH BOARDS HAVE THE SAME NAMES IN  THE 
           SAME ROWS!
           6. GO TO STEP 3.

        7. CHKSIMP    HARDLY SIMPLE BUT AN EXAMPLE OF JUST ABOUT EVERY FORMULA.
