Cursor is controlled with keys E, D, X, and S with the <CNRTL> key held down.
  Direction is up, right, down, and left in that order.  (Control Diamond)
  <RETURN> moves the cursor right if no data has just been typed.
  <CNTRL>Z moves the cursor to the next row, first column.

Data entry: digits 0-9, +, - signal numeric entry.
        alphabetic characters or blank signal text entry.
        /, followed by R, C, or L justifies text right, centered or left.
        ^ is used to switch between text and numeric if needed.
        /= duplicates entry across column. /P causes page break for print.
        ! sets special entry mode for arithmetic modification of input.

Equations may contain numeric data, cell references, and functions.
        four-function arithmetic (+,-,*,/) may be used with any of these.
        @ refers to current cell location.  Type one character and then
        move cursor to collect cell references without typing them.
        ! following a cell reference holds ref constant in relative copy.
        functions include: sum, avg, cnt, abs, exp, log, ln, min, max,
        regr, slope, proj, depd.
