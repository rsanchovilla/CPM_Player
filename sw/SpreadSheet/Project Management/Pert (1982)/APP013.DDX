This disk contains the Performance Evaluation and 
Review Technique (PERT) project management system 
submitted by Doug Hurst.  It is an enhanced version 
of the programs PERT1 and PERT2 found on FOG/APP.005 
and includes a reprint of the original BYTE article 
appearing in May 1982, pp. 465-478 (PERT.DOC).  
PERT80 is intended for use on 80 column matrix 
printers capable of printing in condensed mode (132 
columns per line) and for wide carriage printers 
with 132 column capacity in normal mode.  PERT128 is 
intended for wide carriage matrix printers capable 
of more than 200 columns in condensed mode.  These 
MBASIC progams are set up to send the Epson 
condensed mode command string to the printer.  For 
non-Epson application, change lines 2023 and 2235.

Both PERT tables and a GANNT chart are provided by 
this system.  To run, place the .BAS files in drive 
B and MBASIC.COM in drive A.  At the A> prompt, type
     B:
At the B> prompt, type
     A:MBASIC program
where program represents PERT80 or PERT128.  
PERTTEST is a test file with three activities.

PERTSAMP is a sample run of PERT which will run 
completely thru without operator interaction.  It is 
initiated by AUTOST.  Place these .COM files in 
drive A and perform a cold boot (RESET-RETURN) with 
the printer turned on.  For detailed information, 
see PERT.DOC.
