
                            Calander version 3.2

  Getting around:

      Cursor control (^S^D^E^X) moves the selected day, and works in
      expanded+brief note sections.

      To run just type CAL and enter the date, the program will then
      load the data file for that month. (if it doesn't exist it will
      create a empty data file) Next it displays a calender for the selected
      month.  You may move around and select a day, edit the brief note section,
      edit the expanded note section, delete a day, start with a new month,
      or exit (updating, or deleting if calander is empty, the file for
      the month).
      
  Installation:

      Use a turbo install program (like the one on GENIE) to configure
      CAL.  Please note: the selected-day and error messages are displayed in
      "LowVideo" (reverse video on my H89), and "HighVideo" is the normal
      video mode.

      CAL.COM is configured for all terminals, but if you have a H19...       

      The patch point address: 3ffdH controls support for the H19
      terminal.  
      Use DDT and type: (lower case is user)

  New features:

      Version 3 changes:

        1. Easyer date entery.
        2. The note window moves to keep from covering
           the day it is opened from. 
        3. Optional print-out of your calender.

      Version 3.2 changes:
       
        1. Bug fixes (re-write of printout and calender-display routines)
        2. One version now supports both Generic and H19 terminals
           this keeps down-load time to a minimum.
       

   Problems, Bugs, etc.
