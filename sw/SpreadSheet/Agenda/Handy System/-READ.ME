                        HANDYSYS COMpiled

This is the newly updated HANDYSYS program originally written
by Peter Hawxhurst and re-done by TBKUG member Stephen Wehrenberg.

I have made necessary mods and compiled the series with DRI's
CB80/LK80 compiler producing HANDYSYS.COM and associated .OVLs

All .OVL files and HANDYSYS.COM must be on the same drive and
user area for use.

Just type HANDYSYS <c/r>  to get it going.  It will create all
the necessary .DAT files as it runs.
