INTRODUCTION
------------

This is a "To Do List" manager based on the "todo.txt" format
by Gina Trapani. More info at 'http://todotxt.com'.

It should run in any version of the CP/M operating system, running
in any computer with a Z80 CPU.


PROGRAM FILES
-------------

WTD     .COM -- Command to run the program in CP/M.
WTD     .C   -- Source code.
WTD     .TXT -- This help file.
TODO    .TXT -- Simple text file with our tasks.
COPYING .TXT -- GNU General Public License.


THE PROGRAM
-----------

There are a lot of programs to help us to remember and organize our daily tasks.

But too often, these programs have a big learning curve and / or they are not
easy to use.

This program uses the format and rules described by Gina Trapani in 'http://todotxt.com'.

The "todo.txt" file format has some simple rules, but it is very effective, and is readable
by humans.

As it is a simple text file, it is very easy to copy, send or modify.

It is not implemented yet the "done.txt" file.


FORMAT & RULES
--------------

Here is presented a summary of format and rules as used in "todo.txt" file.

You can read the full set of rules in Gina Trapani website:

https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli/wiki/The-Todo.txt-Format

The "todo.txt" file is a simple text file, and each text line is a task.

Each task has some optional fields and one compulsory field:

Done flag: x          (Optional: It sets a task as 'done'. It must be lowercase.)
Priority:  (A)        (Optional: It sets a priority. Can be (A), (B), (C) ... (Z).
                       It must be uppercase.)
Date:      1977-08-16 (Optional: Date. It is written as YEAR-MONTH-DAY.)
Subject:   any text   (Compulsory: Description of the task.
                       It can contain +Projects and @Contexts.
                       It can contain even own keywords or notations.)

Each field has to be separated by one blank space.

Examples:

x (A) Cut my hair                  > Completed task with priority.
(B) Call John                      > Pending task with priority.
(B) Call John +Party @Phone        > Pending task with priority, project and context.
2014-08-16 Remember Elvis +Music   > Pending task with date and project.
x (C) 2014-12-25 Call Lisa @Phone  > Completed task with priority, date and context.

You can even use your own keywords or notations in the subject field:

(A) Pay tailor due:2015-01-15      > Uses our keyword 'due'.
(B) 2014-01-04 Buy car *SUSPENDED* > Uses our keyword '*SUSPENDED*'.

We can use our +Projects, @Contexts and keywords to filter the tasks we want
to print on the screen.


OPTIONS
-------

Commands and options are completed word as follows:

ADD     {task def}       : Add task. You can enter directly the task following the format
                           as defined before, or the program will ask the fields to you.

FILTERING	
---------

WTD supports simple but effective filtering for the PRINT command by each task field.

When you FILTER by a field (or more fields), each task that matches with the filter
will be printed on screen when you enter the PRINT command.

The filter text will be searched in the task field. If it is found in any position in
the field, it matches the filter.

You can PRINT all tasks when filter is not active:
