                     PX-8 VALDOCS REFERENCE
                           Version 1A

                         By Bill Stoebig

Note:  Valdocs  for  the  PX-8 is a test program  that  has  been 
released  for general use.  It is highly unlikely that it will be 
developed or refined further. It contains some bugs, two of which 
can  result  in  the loss of a document  in  memory.  Deleting  a 
carriage  return  at the end of a line is  fatal--the  PX-8  will 
"freeze  up",  requiring  a reset of the  computer.  The  current 
document  in memory will be lost.  There are two ways of invoking 
this bug:  1) Depressing CTRL + Y together when the cursor is  on 
text  and  2)  Deleting ALL characters on a line  (including  the 
carriage return) using the CLR/DEL dey.  DO NOT depress CTRL +  Y 
for  any  purpose and be careful when using the CLR/DEL key  that 
you do not delete beyond the number of characters on a  line.  If 
you  must  delete  characters,  be sure to save the  document  in 
memory  first so that you will be covered in the  event  disaster 
strikes.  The  second fatal bug,  also resulting in a  freeze-up, 
occurs  when one selects <S>pace available on data disk from  the 
CTRL + K Menu when there is no space left on the drive.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Valdocs  for the PX-8 is a 36K size file;  it is too large to run 
from  the  internal configured ramdisk.  It can be run  from  the 
microcassette but this would be extremely slow due to loading and 
storage  time required.  For practical use,  either  an  external 
Ramdisk (60K,  120K,  or MFU) or a disk drive is required.  It is 
possible  to  burn the program into ROM for those equipped to  do 
so.

FUNCTION KEY ASSIGNMENTS

PX-8 KEY  VALDOCS FUNCTION

STOP      Suspends scrolling through a document.

ESC       UNDO (Back Out of Menu's)

PAUSE     STORE document menu appears:

               ..................................................

               Enter name to store document under ________.VAL

               ..........< UNDO to resume editing >..............


          Enter up to an eight letter name;  the extension, .VAL, 
          is automatically added.  The document will store on the 
          currently  logged drive.  If a document already  exists 
          with the same filename, Valdocs will ask if you want to 
          delete it and replace it with the current file.

HELP      Retrieve/Insert document menu appears:

               ..................................................

               Enter name of document to insert ______ .VAL

               .........< UNDO to resume editing >...............
          
          Enter  the  document  name  you want  to  retrieve  for 
          editing.  If you have forgotten the name, press PF2 and 
          select  <I>ndex of Documents for a listing of files  on 
          the  currently logged drive.  Also,  use this  menu  to 
          merge  a document into one that is currently in memory. 
          Place the cursor in the current document where you want 
          the  merge  to  occur and select  the  document  to  be 
          merged.


PF1       Apparently non-functional UNTIL text is  in the editor; 
          then accesses the PRINT menu:

          .......................................................

          Select a function by its letter or moving the cursor
          then press return

          <P>rint current document   <M>ultiple copies (1-99)
          <S>tart at page number     <W>ait aftereach page (Y/N)
          <E>nding page number[orEND]<C>orrespondence quality(Y/N
          <L>ine spacing (1 to 3)    <N>umber pages starting at

          .............< UNDO to resume editing >................


          This  is  the printer support for Valdocs.  A  document 
          must be active,  or in memory,  to be printed.  You can 
          designate  sections  of  a  document  to  print,  e.g., 
          <S>tart at page 5 and <E>nd at page 7.  If you want the 
          document spaced,  choose the desired spacing as well as 
          the number of copies required.  If you are using single 
          sheet  paper,  select "Y" for <W>ait after  each  page; 
          select  "N"  for  continuous  paper.   <C>orrespondence 
          quality  gives  a NLQ appearance.  If you do want  page 
          numbering to start on other than the first page,  enter 
          the # at <N>umber pages starting at ___.  If you do not 
          want  any page numbering,  enter a "0".  I have  tested 
          these options successfully with an Epson P-80X printer.

PF2       INDEX menu:

          .......................................................

          Select a function by its letter or moving the cursor
          then press return

          <I>ndex of Documents     <A> Ramdisk
          <D>elete Document        <F> Floppy disk
          <R>ename Document        <T>ape storage
          <C>hange disk/tape       <M>ake new data tape

          ...........< UNDO to resume editing >..................


          The  <I>ndex of Documents lists all documents that  are 
          stored on the currently logged drive.  You can <D>elete 
          and  <R>ename documents on the currently logged  drive. 
          The  <A>,  <F>,  and <T> options allow one to log  onto 
          another  storage  device.  For example,  if  you  start 
          Valdocs from the Ramdisk (A drive) and store a file, it 
          will  store  on the Ramdisk.  However,  if  you  select 
          <F>loppy  disk (if one is connected) or <T>ape  storage 
          before  you store the file,  it will be stored  on  the 
          device  you selected.  Accordingly,  one could run  the 
          Valdocs  editor  from  the Ramdisk and store  all  data 
          files  on the disk drive or the microcassette.  If  you 
          are  logged  onto the disk  or  tape  drive,  selecting 
          <C>hange disk/tape will close  the directory and prompt 
          you  to  insert a new disk or tape.  <M>ake a new  data 
          tape will close the current tape,  prompt you to insert 
          a new tape, and initialize it for use.


PF3       Exit to CP/M - the following menu appears:

               ..................................................

               Abandon text now in memory (Y/N) ?

               ..............< UNDO to resume editing >..........


          Note: If no document is in the editor,  depressing  PF3 
          will exit directly to CP/M without the menu appearing.


PF4       Exit to system - the following menu appears:

               ..................................................

               Exit to system
               Abandon text now in memory (Y/N) ?

               ............< UNDO to resume editing >............

          Note:  If no document is in the editor,  depressing PF3 
          will  exit  directly  to the  PX-8's  MENU  screen,  if 
          enabled, without the above menu appearing.


PF5       CALCULATOR menu:

          .......................................................
          
          CALCULATOR: 0    Use the numerical keypad & cursor keys

          <C>LEAR all              <I>NSERT number in document
          <M>EMORY plus <0>        <T>OTAL a column
          <G>ET from memory        <R>OW total
          <Z>ERO memory

          ..............< UNDO to resume editing >...............

          
          Either the number keys in the top row or the  numerical 
          keypad may be used to input numbers. <C>lear all resets 
          the calculator to 0 but leaves any value in memory; use 
          <Z>ero  memory  to  clear all memory to  0.  <T>otal  a 
          column  totals a column of numbers in the  editor.  Put 
          the  cursor in the last number and select  <T>otal  and 
          hit  RETURN.  The total will show in the calculator  at 
          the  cursor.  To  <I>nsert  the total  in  the  editor, 
          position the cursor where you want the total placed and 
          select  <I>nsert  and RETURN.  <R>ow works in the  same 
          manner.  Note: Some of the sub-menu information flashes 
          by  so fast that it's unreadable;  experiment with  the 
          calculator and you will catch on quickly.

CONTROL + KEY ASIGNMENTS

(Depress the CTRL key,  and while it is down,  depress the second 
key.)

KEYS      VALDOCS FUNCTION


CTRL + Q  The "Quirks" Menu:

          .......................................................

          Select a function by its letter or moving the cursor
          then press RETURN

          <D>irectory of disk         <R>etrieve non-indexed file
          <L>og in different disk drive <S>tore as non-indexed
          <F>ormat entire document      <C>ursor locked in center
          <Q>uick Display  

          .................< UNDO to resume editing >............


          <D>irectory of disk lists a directory of the  currently 
          logged  drive.  Selecting <L>og in different disk drive 
          accesses  the  INDEX menu,  which is  also  invoked  by 
          pressing  PF2.  In  Valdocs 1.19 for the  Epson  QX-10, 
          <Q>uick  Display  increased  the speed  of  the  cursor 
          across the display; I have been unable to ascertain any 
          speed  difference on the PX-8.  <R>etrieve and  <S>tore 
          non-indexed  store and retrieve files exactly the  same 
          as under the PAUSE and HELP keys,  described. Both also 
          assign a .VAL extention. <C>ursor locked in center is a 
          toggle  between  "locking" the cursor in the middle  of 
          the  screen and having  text scrolling over  it  versus 
          having  a  "moving" cursor.  Try both methods  and  see 
          which  one you like. <F>ormat entire document  is  used 
          after  inserting or deleting characters.  It  "formats" 
          the  document  reinserting  spaces,  etc.  This  option 
          should   also  be  used  to format the  document  after 
          justifying previously right ragged text.

CTRL + O  The "On Screen" Menu:


          .......................................................

          Select a function by its letter or moving the cursor
          then press RETURN

          <C>enter line on/off     <R>ight margin setting
          <N>on-break space        <T>op of page margin
          <L>eft margin setting    <B>ottom of page margin

          ..............< UNDO to resume editing >...............


          Select <C>enter line to center a line;  however,  there 
          must be a carriage return at the end of the line before 
          it will be centered. Position the cursor in the line to 
          be centered and select this option.  <N>on-break spaces 
          "ties"  two words together so they aren't separated  by 
          more than one space while in the right justified  mode. 
          To tie two words together,  type the first, invoke this 
          menu  option,  and then type the second word.  The four 
          margin setting selections are straightforward.  You can 
          set  multiple  right and left margin  settings  in  the 
          document. As indentations are not supported, use margin 
          changes instead.


CTRL + P  The "Page" Menu:

          .......................................................

          Select a function by its letter or moving the cursor
          then press RETURN

          <G>oto specific page number
          <N>ew page (go to top of new page)
          <I>f within 'N' lines of end, new page
          <S>et length of paper to 'N' lines

          ..............< UNDO to resume editing >...............


          <G>oto  specific  page  moves  the  cursor  and  screen 
          display  to  the selected page.  <N>ew page  moves  the 
          cursor  to  the top of the next page;  it is handy  for 
          starting a new chapter or topic.  <S>et length of paper 
          allows for the differences in paper length for printing 
          purposes.  For example, standard paper is 66 lines long 
          whereas legal paper is 84 lines long.

CTRL + K  The "Miscellaneous" Menu:

          .......................................................

          Select a function by its letter or moving the cursor
          then press RETURN

          <C>hange data disk             <D>elete to end of doc
          <S>pace available on data disk <J>ustify on/off
          <E>rase scrn, refile orig. doc <P>oint char for Dec.
                                                           (./,)

          .............< UNDO to redume editing >................


          Note: Depressing SHIFT + HOME also invokes this menu.

          <C>hange data disk should be used anytime one wants  to 
          change  tapes or disks.  <S>pace available on data disk 
          does  not  appear  to be functional and  LOCKS  UP  THE 
          SYSTEM  when the drive has no storage space  remaining. 
          <E>rase screen clears the current document from  memory 
          without storing it. <D>elete to end of document deletes 
          all  text  from the cursor location to the end  of  the 
          document.  <J>ustify  on/off is a toggle between  right 
          justified or right ragged edge.  Position the cursor in 
          the  document where you want justification to begin (or 
          end) and select this option.  Then,  access the  Quirks 
          Menu  (CTRL  + Q) and select <F>ormat entire  document. 
          <P>oint  char allows one to designate the decimal as  a 
          "." or a ",". I don't know the purpose for this option.


CTRL + S  STORES the document:
