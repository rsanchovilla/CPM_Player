How funny life is!

I am a fan of WS4, and keep finding Valdocs stuff!!!
(While searching for a copy of WS4 for CP/M-86...)

I have never seen or used Valdocs. As far as I have
understood, it was running under a "proprietary" version
of CP/M named "TP/M".

So, imagine my surprise when I saw a CP/M file named
"VALDOCPX.ARC"... Could it be possible that two
different persons would have used the same name?

This archive contains the following files:
EDIT.COM a huge program (36 KB...)
VALDOCS.TXT (a WordStar file, despite its filetype)
VAL2WS.COM and WS2VAL.COM: 2 Turbo Pascal programs
obviously used to convert VALdoc files to WordStar,
and vice-versa, under CP/M.

I dumped EDIT.COM. There are several references to a "STACK".
As it is well-known that Valdocs was written in STOIC, a
Forth-like programming language, I can only conclude that
someone named "SnyderScope" had the source code of Valdocs
and made a CP/M version in 12/25/84.

The WS2VAL.COM author is:
Ted Jerome
New Wave Research
3/04/85
RR#1, Box 380-A,
Waitsfieldn VT 05673

Following this, you will find an ASCII version of the
VALDOCS.TXT file. Of course, that's all I known about it.

Now, some questions are raised:

1) Could a Valdocs user checks the doc to see if it
describes the QX-10 Valdocs editor ?

2) Could some Forth fan confirms that this is really
some zero address code?

3) Could some fan of the Epson PX-8 says where the
escape codes of the PX-8 can be found on the Internet?

4) Could someone patch EDIT.COM, so that it would run
with some more common escape codes, like Kaypro,
ASM 3A, and Osborne (the escape codes recognized
by 22NICE, for example...)

5) Is it difficult to "disassemble" a Forth program?
If EDIT.COM is really a CP/M version of the Valdocs
editor, it should (logically) be written in STOIC...

(Note that EDIT.COM is 36 KB, and the ASM86.COM that
I have disassembled uses 40 KB of the TPA. So it is
possible to disassemble it, but it would be simpler
to ask STOIC to disassemble it...)

6) If so, it would be possible to port it to MS-DOS...
(and to the latest +1 GHz computers)

7) Finally: Who cares?

Yours Sincerely,
"French Luser"



                     PX-8 VALDOCS REFERENCE
                           Version 1A

                         By Bill Stoebig

Note:  Valdocs  for  the  PX-8 is a test program  that  has  been
released  for general use.  It is highly unlikely that it will be
developed or refined further. It contains some bugs, two of which
can  result  in  the loss of a document  in  memory.  Deleting  a
carriage  return  at the end of a line is  fatal--the  PX-8  will
"freeze  up",  requiring  a reset of the  computer.  The  current
document  in memory will be lost.  There are two ways of invoking
this bug:  1) Depressing CTRL + Y together when the cursor is  on
text  and  2)  Deleting ALL characters on a line  (including  the
carriage return) using the CLR/DEL dey.  DO NOT depress CTRL +  Y
for  any  purpose and be careful when using the CLR/DEL key  that
you do not delete beyond the number of characters on a  line.  If
you  must  delete  characters,  be sure to save the  document  in
memory  first so that you will be covered in the  event  disaster
strikes.  The  second fatal bug,  also resulting in a  freeze-up,
occurs  when one selects <S>pace available on data disk from  the
CTRL + K Menu when there is no space left on the drive.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Valdocs  for the PX-8 is a 36K size file;  it is too large to run
from  the  internal configured ramdisk.  It can be run  from  the
microcassette but this would be extremely slow due to loading and
storage  time required.  For practical use,  either  an  external
Ramdisk (60K,  120K,  or MFU) or a disk drive is required.  It is
possible  to  burn the program into ROM for those equipped to  do
so.

FUNCTION KEY ASSIGNMENTS

PX-8 KEY  VALDOCS FUNCTION

STOP      Suspends scrolling through a document.

ESC       UNDO (Back Out of Menu's)

PAUSE     STORE document menu appears:

               ..................................................

               Enter name to store document under ________.VAL

       ,
          is automatically added.  The document will store on the
          currently  logged drive.  If a document already  exists
          with the same filename, Valdocs will ask if you want to
          delete it and replace it with the current file.

HELP      Retrieve/Insert document menu appears:

               ..................................................

               Enter name of document to insert ______ .VAL

               .........< UNDO to resume editing >...............

          Enter  the  document  name  you want  to  retrieve  for
          editing.  If you have forgotten the name, press PF2 and
          select  <I>ndex of Documents for a listing of files  on
          the  currently logged drive.  Also,  use this  menu  to
          merge  a document into one that is currently in memory.
          Place the cursor in the current document where you want
          the  merge  to  occur and select  the  document  to  be
          merged.


PF1       Apparently non-functional UNTIL text is  in the editor;
          then accesses the PRINT menu:

          .......................................................

          Select a function by its letter or moving the cursor
          then press return

          <P>rint current document   <M>ultiple copies (1-99)
          <S>tart at page number     <W>ait aftereach page (Y/N)
          <E>nding page number[orEND]<C>orrespondence quality(Y/N
          <L>ine spacing (1 to 3)    <N>umber pages starting at

          .............< UNDO to resume editing >................


          This  is  the printer support for Valdocs.  A  document
          must be active,  or in memory,  to be printed.  You can
          designate  sections  of  a  document  to  print,  e.g.,
          <S>tart at page 5 and <E>nd at page 7.  If you want the
          document spaced,  choose the desired spacing as well as
          the number of copies required.  If you are using single
          sheet  paper,  select "Y" for <W>ait after  each  page;
          select  "N"  for  continuous  paper.   <C>orrespondence
          quality  gives  a NLQ appearance.  If you do want  page
          numbering to start on other than the first page,  enter
          the # at <N>umber pages starting at ___.  If you do not
          want  any page numbering,  enter a "0".  I have  tested
          these options successfully with an Epson P-80X printer.

PF2       INDEX menu:

          .......................................................

          Select a function by its letter or moving the cursor
          then press return

          <I>ndex of Documents     <A> Ramdisk
          <D>elete Document        <F> Floppy disk
          <R>ename Document        <T>ape storage
          <C>hange disk/tape       <M>ake new data tape

          ...........< UNDO to resume editing >..................


          The  <I>ndex of Documents lists all documents that  are
          stored on the currently logged drive.  You can <D>elete
          and  <R>ename documents on the currently logged  drive.
          The  <A>,  <F>,  and <T> options allow one to log  onto
          another  storage  device.  For example,  if  you  start
          Valdocs from the Ramdisk (A drive) and store a file, it
          will  store  on the Ramdisk.  However,  if  you  select
          <F>loppy  disk (if one is connected) or <T>ape  storage
          before  you store the file,  it will be stored  on  the
          device  you selected.  Accordingly,  one could run  the
          Valdocs  editor  from  the Ramdisk and store  all  data
          files  on the disk drive or the microcassette.  If  you
          are  logged  onto the disk  or  tape  drive,  selecting
          <C>hange disk/tape will close  the directory and prompt
          you  to  insert a new disk or tape.  <M>ake a new  data
          tape will close the current tape,  prompt you to insert
          a new tape, and initialize it for use.


PF3       Exit to CP/M - the following menu appears:

               ..................................................

               Abandon text now in memory (Y/N) ?

               ..............< UNDO to resume editing >..........


          Note: If no document is in the editor,  depressing  PF3
          will exit directly to CP/M without the menu appearing.

               Exit to system
               Abandon text now in memory (Y/N) ?

               ............< UNDO to resume editing >............

          Note:  If no document is in the editor,  depressing PF3
          will  exit  directly  to the  PX-8's  MENU  screen,  if
          enabled, without the above menu appearing.


PF5       CALCULATOR menu:

          .......................................................

          CALCULATOR: 0    Use the numerical keypad & cursor keys

          <C>LEAR all              <I>NSERT number in document

          <G>ET from memory        <R>OW total
          <Z>ERO memory

          ..............< UNDO to resume editing >...............


          Either the number keys in the top row or the  numerical
          keypad may be used to input numbers. <C>lear all resets
          the calculator to 0 but leaves any value in memory; use
          <Z>ero  memory  to  clear all memory to  0.  <T>otal  a
          column  totals a column of numbers in the  editor.  Put
          the  cursor in the last number and select  <T>otal  and
          hit  RETURN.  The total will show in the calculator  at
          the  cursor.  To  <I>nsert  the total  in  the  editor,
          position the cursor where you want the total placed and
          select  <I>nsert  and RETURN.  <R>ow works in the  same
          manner.  Note: Some of the sub-menu information flashes
          by  so fast that it's unreadable;  experiment with  the
          calculator and you will catch on quickly.

key.)

KEYS      VALDOCS FUNCTION


CTRL + Q  The "Quirks" Menu:

          .......................................................

          Select a function by its letter or moving the cursor
          then press RETURN

          <D>irectory of disk         <R>etrieve non-indexed file
          <L>og in different disk drive <S>tore as non-indexed

          <Q>uick Display

          .................< UNDO to resume editing >............


          <D>irectory of disk lists a directory of the  currently
          logged  drive.  Selecting <L>og in different disk drive
          accesses  the  INDEX menu,  which is  also  invoked  by
          pressing  PF2.  In  Valdocs 1.19 for the  Epson  QX-10,
          <Q>uick  Display  increased  the speed  of  the  cursor
          across the display; I have been unable to ascertain any
          speed  difference on the PX-8.  <R>etrieve and  <S>tore
          non-indexed  store and retrieve files exactly the  same
          as under the PAUSE and HELP keys,  described. Both also
          assign a .VAL extention. <C>ursor locked in center is a
          toggle  between  "locking" the cursor in the middle  of
          the  screen and having  text scrolling over  it  versus
          having  a  "moving" cursor.  Try both methods  and  see
          which  one you like. <F>ormat entire document  is  used
          after  inserting or deleting characters.  It  "formats"
          the  document  reinserting  spaces,  etc.  This  option
          should   also  be  used  to format the  document  after
          justifying previously right ragged text.
.pa

CTRL + O  The "On Screen" Menu:


          .......................................................

          Select a function by its letter or moving the cursor
          then press RETURN

          <C>enter line on/off     <R>ight margin setting
          <N>on-break space        <T>op of page margin
          <L>eft margin setting    <B>ottom of page margin

          ..............< UNDO to resume editing >...............


          Select <C>enter line to center a line;  however,  there
          must be a carriage return at the end of the line before
          it will be centered. Position the cursor in the line to
          be centered and select this option.  <N>on-break spaces
          "ties"  two words together so they aren't separated  by
          more than one space while in the right justified  mode.
          To tie two words together,  type the first, invoke this
          menu  option,  and then type the second word.  The four
          margin setting selections are straightforward.  You can
          set  multiple  right and left margin  settings  in  the
          document. As indentations are not supported, use margin
          changes instead.


CTRL + P  The "Page" Menu:

          .......................................................

          Select a function by its letter or moving the cursor
          then press RETURN

          <G>oto specific page number
          <N>ew page (go to top of new page)
          <I>f within 'N' lines of end, new page
          <S>et length of paper to 'N' lines

          ..............< UNDO to resume editing >...............


          <G>oto  specific  page  moves  the  cursor  and  screen
          display  to  the selected page.  <N>ew page  moves  the
          cursor  to  the top of the next page;  it is handy  for
          starting a new chapter or topic.  <S>et length of paper
          allows for the differences in paper length for printing
          purposes.  For example, standard paper is 66 lines long
          whereas legal paper is 84 lines long.

          .............< UNDO to redume editing >................


          Note: Depressing SHIFT + HOME also invokes this menu.

          <C>hange data disk should be used anytime one wants  to
          change  tapes or disks.  <S>pace available on data disk
          does  not  appear  to be functional and  LOCKS  UP  THE
          SYSTEM  when the drive has no storage space  remaining.
          <E>rase screen clears the current document from  memory
          without storing it. <D>elete to end of document deletes
          all  text  from the cursor location to the end  of  the
          document.  <J>ustify  on/off is a toggle between  right
          justified or right ragged edge.  Position the cursor in
          the  document where you want justification to begin (or
          end) and select this option.  Then,  access the  Quirks
          Menu  (CTRL  + Q) and select <F>ormat entire  document.
          <P>oint  char allows one to designate the decimal as  a
          "." or a ",". I don't know the purpose for this option.


CTRL + S  STORES the document:
