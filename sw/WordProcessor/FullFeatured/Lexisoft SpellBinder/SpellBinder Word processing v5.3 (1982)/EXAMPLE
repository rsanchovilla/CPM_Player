Dear Sir:        I would like to take this oportunitty to tell you what a wonderful timewe had in your country.  We especially enjoyed the gardens and monuments.  Wewere excited by the prospect of returning the favor when you come to bisit us.You might find it interesting to to note that the countryside surrounding ourfair city is repleat with natural wonders.  We are nestled between two sets ofmountain ranges. The ocean is only a short drive away with endless beaches toexplore.  Many of the parks have nature walks to explore the flora and fauna. However, we don't have no deserts in the area. the area is simply to plush.        I hope this letter finds you in exceptional health.                                        Your friend,
