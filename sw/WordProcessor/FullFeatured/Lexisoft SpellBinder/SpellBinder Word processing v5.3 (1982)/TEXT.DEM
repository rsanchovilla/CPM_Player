Urban areas that are close together often spread out until theirboundaries merge.  If this phenomenon continues it will result in huge "urbanregions"**.FTThis term was coined by H.G. Wells, who predicted the existence of such regionsin his book Αξτιγιπατιοξσ, published in 1902.  (Harper & Brothers), pp. 67-70..FE containing many cities which have grown together.   Land between cities insuch a region may appear to be rural, but any point in the region will beclearly in the sphere of influence of a nearby city.**.FTChristopher Tunnard, "America's Super Cities," Τανιξη Νεηαμοπομισ, Vol. I, pp.6-10..FE  The result will be an urban area in which the cities may not be spatiallyconnected, but where they are dependent upon and mutually influence each other.     If a city is restricted from spreading out but continues to grow inpopulation, its density must increase.  The skyscraper is one attempt toincrease density and make efficient use of scarce land.  Skyscrapers areconvenient as well as efficient, since they permit interrelated businessactivities to take place in proximity.**.FTJean Gottman, "Why the Skyscraper?" Τανιξη Νεηαμοπομισ, Vol. I, pp. 438-441..FE     One technique for integrated living in skyscrapers is the "vertical city"concept of Paolo Soleri.  These vertical cities would bring together within asingle, huge complex, space for housing, work (both industrial and non-industrial), recreation, shopping, and education.  Such a city, however, wouldbe a radical departure from what many Americans consider a desirable way tolive.  A considerable attitude change must take place before the vertical cityis a realistic alternative.**.FT"Arcology," Ξεχσχεελ (March 2, 1970), pp. 78-79..FE     Another efficient use of urban space would be the construction of hugeunderground systems beneath cities.  This space could be used for storage,parking, automated industry, and high speed transit.**.FT"Subterranean Systems," Αςγθιτεγτυςαμ Ζοςυν (November 1971), pp.58-59..FE  Space above ground would be freed for more compact dwelling, working, andrecreation areas.
