SPECIAL CODES AND COMMAND SEQUENCES


The key map in the manual tells you which keys on your keyboard correspond to
which PALANTIR commands. Then make sure you know how to use the CONTROL key
and the SET and CLEAR commands:

CONTROL--To issue a CONTROL-key command, press CONTROL and keep it de-
     pressed while you are pressing the next key. (Note: your keyboard may
     have special function keys to take the place of CONTROL-key commands)

SET--To issue a SET-key command, press SET once. Release it. Then press
     the next key (example: press SET "!" to begin printing boldface).

CLEAR--To issue a CLEAR-key command, press CLEAR once. Release it. Then 
     press the next key (example: press CLEAR "!" to stop printing boldface).

        The following screen lists the PALANTIR primary commands.  As an
useful exercise with this system, you can modify it to fill in the special
keys for your terminal.  (Edit the file HELP.WPH, beginning line 77).

HOW TO USE "READ" AND "SAVE" AND "BACKUP"


       WHEN YOU WANT TO                     DO THIS

Load a file on the EDIT screen               READ
Save text you put on the EDIT screen         SAVE
Save text you READ on the EDIT screen        SAVE
Use a default filename (in parentheses)      Press RETURN without typing name
READ or SAVE a file with a disk              Enter the disk drive, colon, and
   other than the Default Disk                  filename (e.g., B:MYFILE)
Save revised text and keep editing           BACKUP
Save text and go on to something else        SAVE
SAVE or BACKUP a file larger than            ERASE unnecessary files or SAVE
  the space left on a disk                      to another disk
Discard text without changing it             CANCEL Main Menu. Then type "Y"
Combine files consecutively                  READ first file, then READ next
Äì
HOW TO KEEP FROM LOSING YOUR WORK--USING "BACKUP"


    AFTER THIS TIME                           DO THIS

Every 15-30 minutes                        Use BACKUP
When you get up from the computer          Use BACKUP
At the end of the work day                 Copy files to a reserve disk
At the end of the month                    Rotate your reserve & primary disks
When problems occur                        Copy files to a new disk


NOTE: BACKUP substitutes your current version of a file for the last version
      and erases the next-to-last version. If SAVE or BACKUP fails for any 
      reason, both your original and any prior backup are left intact.

         "LIGHTENING ONLY STRIKES ON THE DAYS YOU DON'T BACKUP"

HOW TO USE THE "PRINT" MENU


  SELECT                                WHEN YOU WANT TO

Offset              Print whole document n-number of columns to the right.
                     (Temporary.  Defaults to OFFSET from the DEFINE menu).
Range               Print part of a document. Press RETURN to accept the
                     defaults, or enter the page number to Begin (if not First)
                     and End (if not Last).
Number of copies    Print more than one copy (enter 2 for two copies, etc.)
Change forms        Pause to feed single sheets to your printer (enter "Y" for
                     "yes, single" or "N" for "no, continuous sheets").
Select printer      Use another printer (enter name of printer if your dealer
                     gave you this option).
Begin               Start printing.

     HINT: BACKUP files before you print them. Then if anything goes
           wrong, you haven't lost any of your text.  (Printer connections
           are a common cause of system "hangup".)

HOW TO USE THE "DEFINE" MENU


SELECT              WHEN YOU WANT TO

Size of Page        Define the physical length of pages (0 for no pages;
                      66 for letter-size; 84 for legal-size).
Top margin          Skip n-number of blank lines from the top of the page.
Bottom margin       Skip n-number of blank lines from the bottom of the page.
Print font          Select an alternative print-wheel (e.g., italics)
                      (You must have a file somename.WPF on the program disk).
Offset              Print the whole document n-number of columns to the right.
Change forms        Pause to feed single sheets to your printer (enter "Y" for
                      "yes, single" or "N" for "no, continuous sheets").
First Page          Begin numbering your pages with a number greater than 1
                      (e.g., page 37 is the first page of chapter two).

TIPS AND MISCELLANY


KEEP FILES SHORT--about 20 K long. Short files are easy and fast to work with.
     Then combine short files (e.g., CHAPTER1, CHAPTER2, etc.) at print time
     by reading them in the EDIT screen one after the other.

BACKUP whenever you can't afford to lose what you've done since the last time
     you used BACKUP.

SELECT APPROPRIATE FORMATS.  We recommend Normal format for most uses.
     It looks like coventional typing -- which is particularly important when
     you're printing customized form letters that you want to LOOK hand-typed.
     Justification gives the most attractive printout if you don't mind that
     your document is obviously machine-processed.  Semi-justification can be
     a convenient compromise: the right margins are less ragged than in Normal
     but the hand-typed look is preserved.  (Semi is only recommended for use
     on printers that spread, rather than add, spacing to justify).  Manual
     formatting is mostly used for non-documents: text files that will be 
     processed by some other program than the PALANTIR.
Äë
HOW TO CHANGE DEFAULT FORMATS


YOU MAY CUSTOMIZE PALANTIR'S DEFAULT FORMATS (e.g., 65-character line width at
      10-pitch, tabs at column 5 and every 10th column thereafter, a 66-line
      page at 6 lines per inch) to suit yourself. DO THIS:

1. Press SET FORMAT to set the initial print ruler the way you prefer it.
2. Type any line of text--just pressing RETURN for a blank line will do.
3. Then return to the Main Menu and select the DEFINE menu.
4. Change any of those settings that you wish.
5. Press RETURN to accept the changes.
6. SAVE the "document" as DEFAULT.WP on the PROGRAM disk.
7. Press CANCEL to return to the operating system.


RESULT--From now on PALANTIR uses your default formats. (You can change these
      settings by using the DEFINE menu and the FORMAT menu, or by editing the
      DEFAULT file. ERASE the file to return to PALANTIR'S original defaults.)
ÄìUsing the FILE Directory to Find Eraseable Files
HOW TO CREATE OR MAINTAIN PROGRAM (non-WP) FILES
        (e.g., a file of source code for an assembler or compiler)


RULES:

1. Use a file type other than WP
2. Use only standard text characters, carriage returns, tabs, and form feeds
3. Don't use special PALANTIR codes (e.g., center tabs, boldface)
4. Use the standards: "Manual" format, 80-column width, 8-column tabs
5. Press RETURN at the end of each line
6. Remember backup files have the type BAK rather than WPB.
7. You may not use RENAME or COPY to change it to a .WP file type
8. You may READ a non-WP file and SAVE it as a .WP file type
    (Don't move the cursor too far into the text before using SAVE.  Once
    PALANTIR moves some text from memory to disk, it is too late to change
    your mind about the type of file.  Re-READ it and SAVE again.)
ÄçSetting Up Your Own HELP Screens
HOW TO MODIFY "HELP" SCREENS


 1.  READ the file HELP.WPH into the EDIT screen.
 2.  Edit the "HELP" file as you would any document--but follow these rules.
 3.  Create "screens" no longer than 20 lines.
 4.  Press SET PAGE to set "hard" page breaks between "screens".
 5.  Create up to 18 menu entries besides the first line, which always takes
      you back to the Main Menu.
 6.  On the next line of the list of menu symbols, type SET ":" to indicate a
      note, then "$" and the next consecutive letter to add another menu item.
 8.  Add a corresponding menu-description line to the menu list.
 9.  Enter your screen(s) in the proper sequence in the body of the file.
 7.  On the first line of the first "page" of the new series, type SET ":" and
      the next consecutive number to identify the series for that menu option.
10.  BACKUP the file and select the HELP function.  Your changes are now in
      the HELP screens.

NOTE: You may ERASE the file HELP.WPH if you want. PALANTIR works without it.
