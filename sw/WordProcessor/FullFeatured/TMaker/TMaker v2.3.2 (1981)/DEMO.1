T/Maker also includes a host of other utility functions.
For example,  suppose you have a list of names like  the
one below.  You can do things such as keep only those in
the list which have a given set of  characters  on  each
line.   In  this  case we will do just that keeping only
those lines which have the characters  "Mr",   then  the
lines will be sorted in alphabetical order,  and finally
new lines will be made out ot the old lines so that  the
number is first and the name and department appear after
it.
