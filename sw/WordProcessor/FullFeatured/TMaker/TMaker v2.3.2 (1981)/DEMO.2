       The real fun of using T/Maker,  however,  is to  make
       tables.  Usually you start with a table like the  one
       below. Notice that tabs were used to make putting the
       data in easier.  Next you  add  headings,  formatting
       information and equations as shown in the next frame.


                       Sales Data

                     1977        1978


        Item A      9           11.1
        Item B      11.23       14.11








       The syntax is so easy,  you can almost  guess  what  it
       means.  The line with "ex" (which stands  for  example)
       tells T/Maker where you want  the  numbers  placed  and
       what they should look like.  Equations are read  across
       the page or down  the page  depending on  whether its a
       row or column equation. Then all you say is "Compute".

                              Sales Data

                      1977        1978   Increase    Total

ex                 9999.99    99999.99   99999.99  99999.99
ac1                    -          +         =
ac2                    +          +                   =
+       Item A      9           11.1
+       Item B      11.23       14.11

=       Total


       When the table  has  been  calculated,   you can  still
       change any number or equation and have the calculations
       done again.  When you have the table correct,  you will
       probably want  to  print  it,   but not  with  all  the
       equations in it. To get them out, you just say "Clean".
