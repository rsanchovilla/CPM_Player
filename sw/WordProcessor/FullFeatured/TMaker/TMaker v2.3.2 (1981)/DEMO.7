You may not always want to keep your data in a  table,   because you
might want to make many tables from one set of data.  T/Maker allows
you to have data files from which the data can be extracted and  put
into tables.  Such a file is edited using the normal  editor.  Lines
which do not have an equal sign are just comments,  so you can  make
your data file look like a table.  The point of a data  file  is  to
associate values with names that you make up yourself.

An example data file is shown below.

name   = 'Acme Glass Company'
street = '1245 North Town Street'
city   = 'Falls Church'
state  = 'Virginia'
zip    = '22042'

emloyee data                76          77         78         79
----------------------------------------------------------------
staff.76   =                 21          23         25         24

sales   data
-----------------------------------------------------------------
sales.76  =               213450     224560   258790    327810

cost    data
-----------------------------------------------------------------
costs.76   =               153450     186546   182132    221753







You may put the same names in tables creating a mask or template  of
a table.  The example below shows such a mask. The braces show where
the data is to be placed.  Special symbols are used to say  how  you
want the data placed.  Then the data can be loaded into the template
using T/Maker's Load function.  We will  now  do  that  as  well  as
the Compute and Clean Functions to show how a complete table can  be
derived from a data base.

       {<street                                                 }
