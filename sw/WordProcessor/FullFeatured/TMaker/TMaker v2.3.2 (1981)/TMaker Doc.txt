        T/MAKER DEMONSTRATION (For 24 x 80 CRT)
 
********************************************************
 
T/MAKER (short for  Table  Maker)  is  a  collection  of
programs  intended  to  help  you  with the analysis and
presentation of numerical data, but making tables is not
all that T/Maker can do.  T/Maker includes a full screen
editor  which  makes  it a useful program development or
word processing tool.
 
While going through this demonstration,  if you see  the
first  answer to the question "WHAT NEXT?" is "wait" (as
it is now) you should touch the space  bar  to  continue
the demonstration.
 
 
 
 
 
T/Maker is being used to demonstrate itself.  All  files
were  created  with the T/Maker Editor and all the logic
involved is being acted on in the normal way.   Clearly,
T/Maker  can  be used to set up complex batch jobs while
you are away from your computer.
 
T/Maker usually deals with one file at a time.  You  may
edit this file or apply any one of a number of functions
to  it.   T/Maker  is like a good set of tools.  You can
solve many problems using T/Maker without ever having to
write a program. Whatever you do the next few days, keep
an eye out for applications that might be  solved  using
T/Maker; we think you'll find many of them.
 
T/Maker also includes a host of other utility functions.
For example,  suppose you have a list of names like  the
one below.  You can do things such as keep only those in
the list which have a given set of  characters  on  each
line.   In  this  case we will do just that keeping only
those lines which have the characters  "Mr",   then  the
lines will be sorted in alphabetical order,  and finally
new lines will be made out ot the old lines so that  the
number is first and the name and department appear after
it.

       The real fun of using T/Maker,  however,  is to  make
       tables.  Usually you start with a table like the  one
       below. Notice that tabs were used to make putting the
       data in easier.  Next you  add  headings,  formatting
       information and equations as shown in the next frame.


                       Sales Data

                     1977        1978


        Item A      9           11.1
        Item B      11.23       14.11








       The syntax is so easy,  you can almost  guess  what  it
       means.  The line with "ex" (which stands  for  example)
       tells T/Maker where you want  the  numbers  placed  and
       what they should look like.  Equations are read  across
       the page or down  the page  depending on  whether its a
       row or column equation. Then all you say is "Compute".

+       Item B      11.23       14.11

=       Total


       When the table  has  been  calculated,   you can  still
       change any number or equation and have the calculations
       done again.  When you have the table correct,  you will
       probably want  to  print  it,   but not  with  all  the
       equations in it. To get them out, you just say "Clean".

       For the sake of example we'll run through  the  calculation
        of  a  few tables showing you the kinds of things which can
        be done.  Tables may be up to 20 columns and 300  positions
        wide.   T/Maker  can  automatically  cut  a wide table into
        suitable panels for your printer.  Notice how easy it is to
        make  a  good  looking table,  because you can put text and
        numbers where you want them to be.
 
        Below some growth rates are calculated  and  used  to  make
        projections.

        Watch how easy it is  to  convert  a  table  of  absolute
        figures into column percents. Another feature can be used
        to turn a table into row percents.

        With the Combine Function of T/Maker,  you can
        do  calculations  across  tables  getting  the
        third dimension if  you  need  to.   Let's for
        example take the average of  the  table  below
        with  a  similar  table  on  disk   that   has
        different numbers.

With T/maker's Tally function,  you can find out the distribution of
any  group  of items in a list.  For example,  Tally will be used to
determine the the number of persons  by  sex  and  department  while
summing the salary over each of these categories.

ou may not always want to keep your data in a  table,   because you
might want to make many tables from one set of data.  T/Maker allows
you to have data files from which the data can be extracted and  put
into tables.  Such a file is edited using the normal  editor.  Lines
which do not have an equal sign are just comments,  so you can  make
your data file look like a table.  The point of a data  file  is  to
associate values with names that you make up yourself.

An example data file is shown below.

name   = 'Acme Glass Company'
street = '1245 North Town Street'
city   = 'Falls Church'
state  = 'Virginia'
zip    = '22042'

staff.76   =                 21          23         25         24

sales   data
-----------------------------------------------------------------
sales.76  =               213450     224560   258790    327810

cost    data
-----------------------------------------------------------------
costs.76   =               153450     186546   182132    221753







You may put the same names in tables creating a mask or template  of
a table.  The example below shows such a mask. The braces show where
the data is to be placed.  Special symbols are used to say  how  you
want the data placed.  Then the data can be loaded into the template
using T/Maker's Load function.  We will  now  do  that  as  well  as
the Compute and Clean Functions to show how a complete table can  be
derived from a data base.

       {<street                                                 }

  T/Maker also has a function called Unload which  can  be  used  to
  take data out of a form or table based on a  template.   That data
  could then be loaded into some other mask. Watch how easy it is to
  take a form  filled  out with  the  editor and generate a piece of
  junk mail. Of course we hope that you will never use  T/Maker  for
  this purpose.

We just learned that you are {  age} years old and that your zip
code is { zip         }. Imagine how pleased we were to find out that
you also  live in our own dear city of { city                    }.
Naturally, we were disappointed when we heard that you are not a member
of our local rooters club. We hope you will fill out the attached
application and return it to us.

                 Sincerely,

That concludes the demonstration of T/Maker.

Your dealer can probably provide you with another diskette
should you wish to try to use T/Maker yourself to see  how
it might solve some of the problems in  your  business  or
