  T/Maker also has a function called Unload which  can  be  used  to
  take data out of a form or table based on a  template.   That data
  could then be loaded into some other mask. Watch how easy it is to
  take a form  filled  out with  the  editor and generate a piece of
  junk mail. Of course we hope that you will never use  T/Maker  for
  this purpose.
