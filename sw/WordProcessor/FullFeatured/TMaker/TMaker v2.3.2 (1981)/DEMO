        T/MAKER DEMONSTRATION (For 24 x 80 CRT)
 
********************************************************
 
T/MAKER (short for  Table  Maker)  is  a  collection  of
programs  intended  to  help  you  with the analysis and
presentation of numerical data, but making tables is not
all that T/Maker can do.  T/Maker includes a full screen
editor  which  makes  it a useful program development or
word processing tool.
 
While going through this demonstration,  if you see  the
first  answer to the question "WHAT NEXT?" is "wait" (as
it is now) you should touch the space  bar  to  continue
the demonstration.
 
 
 
 
 
T/Maker is being used to demonstrate itself.  All  files
were  created  with the T/Maker Editor and all the logic
involved is being acted on in the normal way.   Clearly,
T/Maker  can  be used to set up complex batch jobs while
you are away from your computer.
 
T/Maker usually deals with one file at a time.  You  may
edit this file or apply any one of a number of functions
to  it.   T/Maker  is like a good set of tools.  You can
solve many problems using T/Maker without ever having to
write a program. Whatever you do the next few days, keep
an eye out for applications that might be  solved  using
T/Maker; we think you'll find many of them.

An Example Of Align
-------------------
 
       <<                                           >>
 
Here is some text which was created
using the T/Maker Editor. T/Maker's ALIGN function can be used to
center headings or to make text conform to margin settings
allowing for either a fixed or ragged edge
on the right. The non-text lines
you see at the top of the screen and after the heading
inform Align of where
you want the margins to be and how the text should be placed
within the margins.  When you are typing text, you do not have to worry
about making it look neat; T/Maker can take care of that problem for you.
