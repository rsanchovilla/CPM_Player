There are only two places you will be when using T/Maker:
 
 
(*)  INSIDE THE EDITOR:
 
     1/1 WHAT NEXT?    <EDIT>   or   <E>
 
     *  The  EDIT command puts you inside T/Maker's  Editor,
        and allows you to  enter, modify, and  delete text.
 
(*)  OUTSIDE THE EDITOR:
 
     Type: <CTRL-Q> to "Exit the Editor" and return to prompt.
 
     * T/Maker commands are issued at the WHAT NEXT? prompt.
 
     * You will not lose  any of your work if you decide  to
       momentarily jump out of the T/Maker Editor.
 
Note: SAVE current work area before you GET or CREATE a new file.

You  move  text in  T/Maker with the help of the T/Maker BUFFER.
A buffer is a temporary storage device that holds lines of text.
 
 
*   Place your cursor on the line you want to move or copy.
 
<CTRL-F>  Carbon copy a line to Buffer.
 
<CTRL-G>  Physically move a line to Buffer.
 
 
*   Move your cursor to the line where you want text inserted.
 
<CTRL-D>  Insert a copy of the Buffer.
 
 
*   Cleaning the Buffer.

MOVING LINE SEGMENTS
 
 
 
<ESC>  >   Break Line:        (Moves everything from cursor over down one line)
 
 
<ESC>  <   Join Line :        (Brings line below up to cursor line. Connects at
                               cursor.)

<ESC>  )   Set Right Line Segment Mark
 
<CTRL S>   Copy Line Segment (same line)
<CTRL G>   Move Line Segment (same line)

SEARCHING & REPLACING
 
While in the T/Maker Editor,
 
<ESC> <'>     Search for a word/phrase
 
 
<ESC> <&>     Continue search
 
 
<ESC> <">     Replace a word/phrase
 
 
 
 
HINT #1:   If  you  "accidentally"  hit the  search  keystroke,  simply
           search  for anything to get back to EDIT Mode.
 
HINT #2:   If you hit the replace keystrokes without meaning to replace
           something, replace something with itself.    [ replace z z ]
+ 2 MODE
CARRIAGE RETURN MODES
 
Choose from 3 different Carriage Return Modes. T/Maker starts in the
Manual Return Mode.  By hitting  <ESC> R   once, and you'll "toggle"
to Drafting (wordwrap mode).  Hit <ESC> R again, you'll  toggle into
Table Mode.
 
 
<ESC> <R>     Manual Return Mode    (You must manually return the cursor
                                     when it gets to end of screen).
 
<ESC> <R>     Drafting Return Mode  (Same as automatic wordwrap - cursor
                                     is automatically returned at col 63)
 
<ESC> <R>     Table Mode            (Horizontal scrolling across screens)
 
 
 
 
To clear mode change report, type:   <ESC> <#>    (which redraws screen).
+
OTHER T/MAKER MODES
 
 
<ESC> <I>      Insert Mode
 
Sets T/Maker to Automatic-Continuous Insert of text.
 
 
 
 
<ESC> <F>      Frame Mode
 
 
You can frame certain areas of text so that they will not be affected
by cursor movements.  Place the cursor in between  the area you  wish
to stabilize and the area you wish to scroll through and type:<ESC> F
 
 
Note: Frame Mode is especially useful for scrolling spreadsheets.
                 ( See   [ FRAME ]  for more information. )

A  KEYSTROKE MACRO  remembers a sequence of keystrokes.
 
 
 
 
<CTRL-B>    Begin Macro               (Starts recording keystroke sequence)

Note:  Once you Exit the Editor, T/Maker will forget your keystroke sequence.

 <<                  >>                Top Line of Screen.  See  AA  for

                                    *  WEDGES  are  placed on a separate
 <<                 ->>                line ABOVE text to be ALIGNed.
    FIRST LINE FREE                    (This Align-Line will not print.)
 RIGHT-RAGGED EDGE.
                                    *  Continues to  ALIGN  until  a new

  STOP ALIGNING TEXT                   specify only WEDGE on that side.
+ 2 PRINT
 1/1 WHAT NEXT?   <PRINT IT>    or    <PRINT DiskFile>
 
 
PRINT work on the active area.  * (See  AA  for more information.) *
The  PRINT command  brings the  printer's prompt to the screen:
 
 
                    NEXT PAGE 1 (YES.SCREEN.NO.GO.QUIT)?
 
Options:
 
<Y>     Prints the next page to the printer.
 
<S>     Prints the next page to the screen for pre-viewing.
 
<N>     SKIPS the next page, and re-prompts you for next next page.
 
<G>     Prints all the work file pages,  without further prompting.
 
<Q>     Quits the  PRINT  command.
+
Because T/Maker allows you to  "stack"  commands,  you can specify
some of the PRINT options before giving the filename or IT option.
 
 
<NONSTOP >   Pre-answers printer's prompt with   Y.
 
<NUMBER n>   First page is number  n.
 
<FROM  n >   Start printing from page   n.
 
<TO  n   >   Print pages through page   n.
 
 
Text will only be PRINTed in the active area.    (Everything below
the cursor just before Exiting the Editor.)
 
 
Example: PRINT work file pages 10 through 20 continuously without prompts.
 
1/1 WHAT NEXT?  < PRINT NONSTOP FROM 10 TO 20 IT >
+ 2 PD
 * PRINT  DESIGN  COMMANDS *
 
 The  following  Print Design commands  go in your text and tell the printer
 what "action" to take. (Of course, the PD's won't show up in the printing.)
 Print Design commands (PD)  always  start with a   .   in the first column,
 followed  by  the action.  Action will continue in force until an overiding
 action is requested.

 .width 80         Sets page or panel width at,        e.g., 80 columns
 .pagesize 66      Sets physical page size of a page,  e.g., 66 lines
 .length 60        Sets  usable  length of a page,     e.g., 60 lines
 .number 3         Sets page # of current page, e.g, first page numbered 3

 .continue filename   Tells  the  printer to automatically  get the next file
                      and print it.  Working file can contain many  .continues

 These lines will appear at bottom of each page with page numbers.
+ 2 CHAIN
 CHAINING T/MAKER TEXT FILES TOGETHER
 
 
 
 You may decide to do a large report or paper in  "sections".   You  can
 "chain" T/Maker text files together (so that pages automatically number
 correctly) by using the:
 
 
 
 .continue  filename
 
 
 
 .CONTINUE   is a Print Design command and must begin in the first column.
