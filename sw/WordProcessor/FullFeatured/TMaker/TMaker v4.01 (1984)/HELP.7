   1/1 WHAT NEXT?  PROOF
                   -----
       The PROOF Command checks the working area for any words which
    are NOT in the T/Maker Dictionary or other specified dictionaries.
 
  NO distinction is made between UPPER & LOWER case when searching for words
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * PROOF prepares a "Correction List" of words NOT found in the dictionary.
 
          The list is made up of  "Correction Lines".
          Each line in this list looks like:     =!   word     word
 
          The first occurence of the "word" may be thought of as the
   CURRENT SPELLING of the word in the file.
 
          The second occurence of the "word" may be thought of as the
   optional spelling to be corrected and later substituted.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   **  PROOF also marks unindentified words in the text by preceding them
           with a "Spell-Marker", that is, the sybmol:       ?=

+ 1 CORRECT
1/1 WHAT NEXT?  CORRECT
                -------
       CORRECT will "correct" the working area based on the "correction
                   list"  produced by the Command PROOF.
 
 
                     You have 4 OPTIONS at this point:
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Option # 1:  Use the SPELL Command to show a listing of possible correct
                 spellings  (SEE MORE ON SPELL COMMAND BELOW).
 
 ---------------
Option # 2:  The word is an obvious misspelling and you correct the
                       SECOND OCCURENCE of the word (on Correction Line).
 
             CORRECT will then substitute all occurences of the FIRST
                OCCURENCE with that of the SECOND.
 
             CORRECT will also remove all   ?=   (Spell-Markers) from the file.
+
 ---------------
Option # 3:  The word is correct, however, it is NOT in the Dictionary
                and should be INCLUDED.  (See case of "quadraphonic" below).
 
           To ADD a word to a Dictionary, you must first change the
              Correction Line Symbol  (=!)  to an "Amend+Marker"  symbol  (+=).
              Subsequent use of the AMEND Command will add the word to
              the Dictionary and remove the Correction Line from the file.
 ---------------
Option # 4:  The word is correct and is NOT in the Dictionary and should NOT
                be included in the source. (See case of "Isuzu" below).
 
             You leave the Correction Line unchanged.  The CORRECT Command
                will delete the Correction Line and corresponding occurences
                of Spell-Markers  (?=)  in the text.
 ---------------
Option # 5:  The correctness of the word is impossible to determine without
                looking at the word in context.
 
             Use the SEARCH Command to find this condition.

1/1 WHAT NEXT?  SPELL
                -----
SPELL lists words from a Dictionary on the screen or places them on
 ------------------------------------------------------------ Correction Lines.
You MUST give T/Maker an AMBIGUOUS WORD REFERENCE.            ----------------
 
   An   Ambiguous Word Reference   is made up:
 
           ?     A Question Mark is used to represent one unknown letter.
           *     An Asterisk is used to represent zero or more unknown letters.
Examples:
 _____________________________________________________________________________
#1           b?m*ing         This  Ambiguous Word Reference  would list all
                             words that start with    b    , have any second
                             letter, has    m     for a third letter, and
                             ends with an    ing    .

+ 1 AMEND
   1/1 WHAT NEXT?  AMEND
                   -----
 
   AMEND creates or updates a Dictionary from a list of corrections in
                                                                work area.
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
       Correction Lines that begin with    +!     (Amend+Marker) are
            ADDED to the Dictionary.
 
       Correction Lines that begin with    -!     (Amend-Marker) are
            DELETED from the Dictionary.
 
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
      Lines of the above form will be REMOVED from the working area AFTER
                      the Dictionary has been AMENDed.
