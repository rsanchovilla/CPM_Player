Select Example---
 
The SELECT command is typically used to generate reports by
extracting records from a data file that meet specific criteria.
The above command line will select records from the file ORDER.DEX
all the orders for GLUE in excess of $5000.
 
The SELECT command may also be used to reformat the database
structure.  New fields may be added and old ones deleted.
For an example of this feature, see file SELECT1.DEX.
An interesting application of this feature can be used
to select numeric fields and incorporate them into a
spreadsheet.  For an example of this application, see
file SELECT2.DEX.
