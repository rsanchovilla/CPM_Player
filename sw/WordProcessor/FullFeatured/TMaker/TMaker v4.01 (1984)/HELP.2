+ 1 COMPUTE
1/1 WHAT NEXT?  COMPUTE
                -------
 
           COMPUTE tells T/Maker to "calculate" values according to the
           horizontal calculation lines and vertical calculation strips.
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
       To successfully "calculate" a T/Maker SpreadSheet:
 
   (Must Have)    An EXAMPLE LINE
 
   (Must Have)    VERTICAL CALCULATION STRIP(S)
 
   (Optional)     HORIZONTAL CALCULATION LINE
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
  *  You can intersperse as much text above, around, under, or inbetween
     a SpreadSheet Table as you wish.
+ 2 EX
                      ** Calculation By EXample **
 
T/Maker "calculates by example".   An EXample line contains MODEL NUMBERS
that tells T/Maker where you wish to place your values, and what accuracy
they should have.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
EX     9,999     9.99     9.99999999999   9,999,999.99
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
     T/Maker loosely defines a "cell" as the area underneath the MODEL
     NUMBERS of the EXAMPLE LINE on all Spreadsheet Rows. Numbers are
     entered underneath MODEL NUMBERS.
 
Please Note:  An EXAMPLE LINE consists of:
 
       1)  The two letters    EX    in the FIRST TWO COLUMNS.
        The first 7 columns are RESERVED for Operators and Terminators ONLY!
 
       2)  Model Number(s) STARTING from column 8 onward.
        A MODEL NUMBER tells the ACCURACY and FORMAT of a column of numbers.
+ 2 VCS
  A    VERTICAL CALCULATION STRIP   (VCS)    is a "sideways" equation - very
similar to the type we used on ChalkBoards when performing basic math as
students.  Certain rules must be followed, however:
 _____________________________________________________________________________
 
  *  All rows in a speadsheet must have either an Operator or a Terminator
           in one of the first 7 Reserved Columns.
 
  *  All Operators or Terminators forming a VERTICAL CALCULATION STRIP
           equation MUST be in the same column.
 
  *  You may start a New Equation in the same column immediately AFTER
           a Terminator...
 
  *  The Vertical Equation will be carried out on EVERY COLUMN in a TABLE.

    :..................:             :.................:
 A "DATA ROW" has NO Terminator in it:  A "DERIVED ROW" HAS a Terminator in it.
 
NOTE: Remember the "Visor" Principal; Always "home cursor" before each COMPUTE.
+ 2 VISOR
  The VISOR PRINCIPAL:
       Because T/Maker is like a giant ChalkBoard that you constantly
step up to  (In the Editor)  and step away from  (Outside the Editor),
T/Maker has to have a way of "positioning" the screen when you Exit
the Editor (After all, your screen can only hold 80 columns and 24 rows;
we know T/Maker's ChalkBoard is much larger than that).
 
       Thus, T/Maker assumes that the line that you Exit the Editor on
becomes the Top Line that you will see on your screen.  The Top Left
coordinates are displayed to the left of the   WHAT NEXT?  prompt.
 
      The VISOR PRINCIPAL says:  T/Maker wears a VISOR HAT when it
      Exits the Editor - It CANNOT see above the Top Line of the Screen.
 
      This means that T/Maker will IGNORE information above the Top
      Line of the Screen - which means you MUST Home the Screen or
      or Home the Cursor before you execute a   COMPUTE   (or ALIGN, etc...)
 
  The ONLY exception to the VISOR PRINCIPAL is the SAVE Command: a SAVE
              will always SAVE the entire current work file.

               _____HORIZONTAL CALCULATION LINES (HCL)_____
 
 
      Horizontal Calculation Lines (HCL's) are horizontal equations
                         in a T/Maker SpreadSheet.
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
     *  ALWAYS begin with a "Calculation Line Control Code"  (See below).
 
     *  Operators & Terminators MUST appear underneath  Model Numbers on the
              EXample Line.
 
+
             _____The SIX Calculation Line Control Codes_____
 
*  Control Codes specify the set of rows upon which the specific HCL
      Equation will be carried out on.
 
*  HCLs have a number in the third column which specifies the order in which
     the equation will be carried out RELATIVE to the other Calculation Lines.

1/1 WHAT NEXT?  CLEAN
                -----
 
     CLEAN "wipes out" all notation for VERTICAL CALCULATION STRIPS and
HORIZONTAL CALCULATION STRIPS,  making a T/Maker COMPUTE Table suitable
for report publication. (CLEAN eliminates the first 7 columns of text.)
 
     CLEAN will leave Print Design Commands intact, however.
 _____________________________________________________________________________
 WARNING:  If you issue a CLEAN Command without first SAVE-ing a SpreadSheet,
you canNOT get your Vertical or Horizontal Equations back.
 
       SOLUTION: SAVE before CLEANing
 
BETTER SOLUTION: Use the Print DESIGN COMMAND   .CLEAN      before each Table,
 
                                          and   .NOCLEAN    after each Table.
 
You won't lose any equations & your Tables will still be "publication quality".

                -------
 
     COMBINE allows you to "combine" a SpreadSheet in the Work File Area with
similar SPREADSHEETS on disk on a CELL by CELL basis.
 
     A COMBINE Must:  Have at LEAST one Operator and one Terminator.
                      Have parameters separated by ONE SPACE.
