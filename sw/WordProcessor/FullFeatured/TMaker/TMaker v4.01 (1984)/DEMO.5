     First, you must set up a database.  The database, designed by
     you as a plain text file in T/Maker's Editor, can contain any
     information you want, and can be easily added to or changed at
     any time.  The one we used for this example contains about one
     hundred customers.  You can view or update this file through
     the T/Maker command UPDATE.  If you request UPDATE, the
     following screen would appear:

    T/Maker does this by applying a given set of rules.
    For our order entry system, we've set up the following rules:
 
 _____________________________________________________________________________
 
 
            VALUE = (BASS * 49.95) + (VEG * 39.95) + (PEELER * 10.95)
            TAX = .065 * VALUE WHEN STATE = CA
            TAX = "NO TAX" WHEN STATE NOT = CA
            DUE = VALUE + TAX
 
 
 _____________________________________________________________________________
 
 
    These tell T/Maker what the prices are for the products,
    how much sales tax to charge (only to California Residents!)
    and how to calculate the total due.  T/Maker will then fill
    in your order, so it looks like this:
