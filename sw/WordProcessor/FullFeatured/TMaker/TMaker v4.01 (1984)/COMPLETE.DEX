Complete Example---
 
The COMPLETE command links information from two or more separate data
files.  It brings in data into the work file on the basis of a key field.
 
The command line at the top will bring in customer data from the file
UPDATE.DEX on the basis on the customer's last name, "lname."  It performs
a similar operation to the product data by completing the information about
the product, namely, its description, price, and part number.
