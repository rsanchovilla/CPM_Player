    The  EDIT  Command puts you into T/Maker's Editor, and allows you to
                    enter, modify, and delete text.
 
    You "run" around T/Maker via "T/Maker KeyStrokes".  KeyStrokes give you
   extensive control over the screen cursor.
 
 
    REMEMBER - You use the EDIT Command for EVERYTHING you do with T/Maker
   (That is, you will create SpreadSheets, DataBases, form letters, etc...
                     ... with the T/Maker EDITor.)

                To Exit T/Maker's Editor, type:   <CTRL>Q
                                                  -------
 
 
        You will NOT lose any of your work if you decide to momentarily
                      jump out of the T/Maker Editor.
 
 
 
   HOWEVER:    If you want to  GET  or  CREATE  another workfile, make sure
you  SAVE the current workfile.   You WILL lose the changes you just made
to the file if you don't tell T/Maker to  SAVE them for you.

  _____Getting Information About A File_____
 
 
 
OUTSIDE THE EDITOR:
 
   1/1 WHAT NEXT?  INFO
                   ----
 
 
INSIDE THE EDITOR:
 
  To get the INFO Line, type:  <ESC> ?      To get rid of it, type:  <ESC> #
                               -------         (Clean Screen)        -------
 
 
 
       Note:  The INFO Line will NOT affect any part of your workfile.

                      _____Moving Text With T/Maker_____
 
         You Move Lines in T/Maker with the help of the T/Maker BUFFER.
   The BUFFER is a temporary STORAGE DEVICE (holding 150 lines of text).
 
 
          *   Place your cursor on the line you want to move or copy.
 
 Carbon  COPY  a line to Buffer    :       <CTRL>F
         ----
 Physically  MOVE  a line to Buffer:       <CTRL>G
             ----
 
          *   Move your cursor to the line where you want Text Inserted.
 
 INSERT a copy of the Buffer,  type:       <CTRL>D

                       _____Searching & Replacing_____
 
 
While in the T/Maker Editor,
 
   SEARCH for a String by typing......<ESC> '
 
   CONTINUE the Search by typing......<ESC> &
 
   REPLACE a String by typing.........<ESC> "
 
 
 ---------
   HINT: If you "accidentally" hit the SEARCH KeyStrokes, simply SEARCH for
   ANYTHING to get back to EDIT Mode.
 
   HINT#2:If you "accidently" hit the REPLACE KeyStrokes without meaning to
   REPLACE something, simply REPLACE something with itself.
                                                   EX: REPLACE z z
+ 2 CM
                       _____CARRIAGE RETURN MODES_____
 
   Choose from 3 different Carriage Return Modes. T/Maker starts in the:
MANUAL RETURN MODE.  By hitting   <ESC> R   once, and you'll "toggle"
to DRAFTING or WordWrap MODE.  Hit   <ESC> R   again, you'll "toggle" into
TABLE MODE.
 
 
<ESC> R      1) MANUAL RETURN Mode    ( You must manually return the cursor
                                        when it gets to the end of the screen).
 
<ESC> R      2) DRAFTING RETURN Mode  ( Same as Automatic Word-Wrap - Cursor
                                        is automatically returned at column 63)
 
<ESC> R      3) TABLE Mode  (Cursor will NOT return at end of screen. Instead,
                      will continue scrolling across all 300 character columns)
 
      When you ask for a MODE CHANGE, T/Maker will give you an INFO LINE
   report, which tells you the appropriate Mode Change was made.  To
   CLEAR  this report,  type:       <ESC> #      (which REDRAWS the Screen).
+
                     _____Other  T/Maker  "MODES "_____
 
 
                      INSERT MODE: Type:    <ESC> I
                                           ---------
           Sets T/Maker to Automatic-Continuous INSERT of Text.
 
 
 
 
 
                       FRAME MODE: Type:   <ESC> F
 
                                          ---------
   You can FRAME certain areas of text so that they will not be affected
   by cursor movements. Place the cursor inbetween the area you wish
   to STABILIZE and the area you wish to SCROLL through and type: <ESC> F

                         _____Keystroke Macros_____
 
 
   A Keystroke Macro remembers  EVERY keystroke you ask it to, and REPEAT
            the sequence as many times as you would like it to.
 
 
 
 
BEGIN MACRO                :    <CTRL>B    (Starts RECORDING Every KeyStroke)
 
END MACRO/ EXECUTE ONCE    :    <CTRL>X    (Ends RECORDING Session... )
 
END MACRO/ EXECUTE # TIMES :    <CTRL>Z    (Repeats Every KeyStroke hit)
 
 
 
 
 NOTE: Once you Exit the Editor, T/Maker will forget your Keystroke sequence.
+ 1 ALIGN
   1/1 WHAT NEXT?  ALIGN
                   -----
        T/Maker uses VISUAL SYNTAX wherever possible.  T/Maker ALIGNs text
     using on-screen ALIGNing WEDGES.  You give T/Maker an example of the
     ALIGNment you want via Left and Right ALIGNing Wedges PLACED ABOVE the
     text to be ALIGNed - Exit the Editor and type:  ALIGN   - and T/Maker
     will ALIGN your text per your example.
 
                            " ALIGN BY EXAMPLE "
               (EXAMPLE WEDGES placed above text to be ALIGNed)
 
   <<<                 >>     <<<                ->>             >><<
   RIGHT & LEFT JUSTIFIED     RIGHT-RAGGED EDGE          STOP ALIGNING TEXT
   has margins like this.     looks kinda like this.
 
 
   <<                  >>     <<                 ->>     <<-             >>
       FIRST  LINE  FREE.         FIRST LINE FREE.            CENTERED
   RIGHT & LEFT JUSTIFIED     RIGHT-RAGGED EDGE                 TEXT
   for the remaining text     for the remaining text.        (perfect!)
+
   ALIGN       hints!
   -----
     Please Note:  Only one set of WEDGES per Line.  Text continues to be
   ALIGNed by above EXAMPLE ALIGN LINE until it hits new EXAMPLE ALIGN LINE.
 
      ALIGNing text follows the T/Maker VISOR Principal:  T/Maker can only
   "see" from the point it exits the work file downwards. Thus, T/Maker
   will ALIGN text from the point we jump out of the Editor downward.
 
        Don't worry about the Wedge Line showing up when you print your
   work file.  They won't!
 
        You can also TAG a Wedge for future use. Define the TAG with a
   one letter name.  For Example:
        <<<                       a                     >>
 
        To recall this wedge, you need only to type the following:
   <<=a
+ 1 PRINT
   1/1 WHAT NEXT?  PRINT
                   -----
 T/Maker will PRINT the Workspace or disk file by prompting you with:
 
   1/1 WHAT OPTION OR FILENAME (OR 'IT')?
 
        To PRINT Current Workspace, type:    IT
        To PRINT another Disk File, type:    filename
 
 The PRINT Command brings the Printer's Prompt to the screen:
   NEXT PAGE 1 (YES.SCREEN.NO.GO.QUIT)?
 
        One of the following answers should be given:
       .......
       :  Y  :   Prints the next page to the printer.
       :  S  :   Prints the next page to the screen for pre-viewing.
       :  N  :   SKIPS the next page, and re-prompts you for next next page.
       :  G  :   Prints all the workfile pages, without further prompting.
       :  Q  :   Quits the PRINT command.
       :.....:
+
 PRINT
 -----
        Because T/Maker allows you to "stack" Commands, you can specify
   some of the PRINT Options before giving the filename or IT option.
 
          ................
          :   NONSTOP    :     Pre-answers Printer's Prompt with Y.
          :   NUMBER n   :     Start numbering pages with n.
          :   FROM n     :     Start printing from page n.
          :   TO n       :     Print pages through page n.
          :..............:
 
       PRINTing text follows the T/Maker VISOR Principal:  T/Maker can only
   "see" from the top of the screen downwards. Thus, T/Maker will PRINT text
   from the point we jump out of the Editor downward.
 _______________
   EX: PRINT the work file pages 10 through 20 continuously without prompts.
 
              1/1 WHAT NEXT?   PRINT NONSTOP FROM 10 TO 20 IT

+ 2 DC
                      _____Print DESIGN COMMANDS_____
 
The following PRINT DESIGN Commands go in your text and tell the printer
what "action" to take. (Of course, the DC's won't show up in the printing.)
Print Design Commands (DC) ALWAYS start with a   .   in the first column,
followed by the ACTION.  ACTION will continue in force until an overiding
ACTION is requested.
 
 .width 80        (Sets page or panel width at, e.g., 80 columns)
 .pagesize 66     (Sets physical page size of a page, e.g., 66 lines)
 .length 60       (Sets usable length of a page, e.g., 60 lines)
 .number 3        (Sets page # of current page, e.g., start numbering at page 3)
 
 .single          (Single spaces the following text)
 .double          (Double spaces the following text)
 
 .clean           ("Clean" the Equations in the following table before printing)
 .noclean         (Prints the following table with Math Equations showing)
 
 .indent 6        (Shifts the following text 6 positions to the right)
+

 .=               (Underscores all words in previous line)
 .&               (Overprints previous line with next line)
 
 .                (Re-Start ALIGNing)
 .,               (Does ALIGNing before & after the line-but leaves line as is)
 ..You Bozo !     (Comment Line - line appears on screen but does not print)

                            BLOCKing TEXT
 
   .block
             BLOCKing Text forces everything in the "block" to be printed
            on the same page.
 
             BLOCKing Text is especially useful in making sure the bottom
            of a Table will not get "chopped off" and partially printed on
            the following page.

                          TOP ROUTINE    (Page Heading)
 
 
   This line will appear at the top of each page starting with page number 2
  It can also be used to number the pages. T/Maker will replace the "#" sign
  in the line above with the correct page number

    This line will appear at the bottom of each page. A Number Sign (#) within
 Bottom Routines provides for automatic page numbering.

                   _____Linking T/Maker Text Files Together_____
 
 
       You may decide to do a large report or paper in "sections".  You can
   "link"  T/Maker text files together (so that pages automatically number
   correctly) by using the:
 
 
    .continue filename      PRINT DESIGN COMMAND.
    ------------------
 
 
       *  The working file can contain numerous   .continue  Commands.
 
       *  T/Maker will recognize the first  .continue  Command in a disk file.
 
       *  .continue  is a PRINT DESIGN Command and MUST begin in the
                              FIRST COLUMN
