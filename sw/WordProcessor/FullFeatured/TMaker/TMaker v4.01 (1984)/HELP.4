+ 1 ARRANGE
1/1 WHAT NEXT?  ARRANGE
                -------
 
    ARRANGE reorders the sequence of columns for lines in the work-file.
       The columns to be reordered are identified by number-pairs.
 
    The first number marks the left boundary and the second marks the
       right boundary.
 
    The new order of columns is determined by the sequence of the number-pairs.
 
    Print design commands are not affected by the ARRANGE command.
 
EX:   1/1 WHAT NEXT?   ARRANGE 11 20  1 10  21 300 END
                       -------------------------------
 
     Columns 11 20 will be the leftmost columns, followed by
     columns 1 10 and then the remainder of the line.
