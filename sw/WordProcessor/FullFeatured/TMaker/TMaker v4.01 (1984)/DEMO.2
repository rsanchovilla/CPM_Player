     Dear BOB;
 
That's right - it's that exciting time of  year  again  -  time  for  the
annual     GRAND     WATER     BUFFALO      STAMPEDE   &   DANCE    GALA.
 
BOB,  I  remember  how  instrumental              you were in making last
  year's event  so successful.                    That's why I'm placing
you on the volunteer list early this                  year. A person with
your   managerial  skills & talents will               guarantee a smooth
 operation and a good time for all at                   this year's GALA.
 
          Being the "take-charge" kind of guy I know you are, BOB,you'll
                    probably want to get a jump on the GALA arrangements.
                   After all, only 9 months to GALA time! We'll have our
                       first meeting WED the 21st at the lodge after our
           regular meeting and penny-poker session. Welcome to the team !

     are listed under the "application examples" in the Demo Menu)

     our sales district.  Please notice that we've entered our values
     in a very sloppy and inconsistent manner.
 
     Don't worry, T/Maker will take care of everything for us!

   T/Maker CALCULATES BY EXAMPLE;  that is, we give it an example of how
   we want everything to look - and where we want it placed, and T/Maker
   does all the work for us!
 
   The first line below (starting with EX) is the EXAMPLE LINE.  The
   99,999.99 column place-holders or Model Numbers tell T/Maker how each
   column is to be formatted.
 
   We loosely-defined our T/Maker "cell" through the use of an Example Line
