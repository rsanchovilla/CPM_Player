                T/MAKER INSTALLATION PROCEDURE AND OTHER NOTES
 
T/Maker now has a few additions not covered in the Reference Manual.  These,
and how to get T/Maker ready to run, are discussed in this note.
 
Installation
 
T/Maker has been supplied on either two double-sided 48 tpi disks or one
double-sided 96 tpi disk.  In the two-disk set, all of the basic working
commands are on the "COMMAND" disk, while the spelling checker and T/Maker
demonstrations are on the "SPELLING & DEMO" disk.
 
Before you can run T/Maker you must create a T/Maker SYSTEM disk.  The
distribution T/Maker disks supplied by AMPRO do not have CP/M on them.  We
have included FRIENDLY and several AMPRO utilities on the COMMAND disk for
your convenience.  Use the following procedure.  (Please refer to your system
user's manual for details on how to use the AMPRO utilities referenced.)
 
1.  Use AMPRODSK to make a copy of your T/Maker COMMAND disk.  This will
become your T/Maker SYSTEM disk.
 
2.  Use SYSGEN to copy your CP/M system onto your T/Maker SYSTEM disk from a
working system disk.
 
3.  If you plan to use FRIENDLY on your T/Maker SYSTEM disk, you must also
copy an installed version of MYTERM.Z3T from your T/Maker SYSTEM disk onto
your new T/Maker SYSTEM disk.  MYTERM.Z3T is the file created when you install
FRIENDLY.  Consult your system documentation if you need help.
 
4.  Finally, T/Maker itself needs to be installed for your terminal.  Place
your new T/Maker SYSTEM disk in drive A and press your system's RESET button.
If you are using FRIENDLY, use the "M" (manual) command.  After the CP/M
prompt appears, type:  A0>TMODIFY<RETURN>.
 
The program is self documenting.  Normally all that is required is to select a
terminal from the list of standard terminals, option [1].  If you need help,
refer to your T/Maker Reference Manual CUSTOMIZATION section.
 
Starting T/Maker
 
To start T/Maker, use one of the numbers in the FRIENDLY command menu, or
type:  A0>TMAKER<RETURN> from CP/M's prompt.  You should soon see the
T/Maker Integrated Software logo, explaining how to get HELP and the COMMAND
MENU.  At the bottom of the screen, you will see T/Maker's prompt:  1/1 WHAT
NEXT?
 
Using On-Line HELP
 
At any WHAT NEXT?  prompt, type:  HELP<RETURN>.
 
NOTE:  If you are in the middle of an EDIT session and do not have the WHAT
NEXT?  prompt on the bottom line of the screen, type <CTRL>-Q to quit the
editor.  (Don't worry, you won't lose any of your work by exiting the editor
to use HELP.)
 
To end a T/Maker HELP session type:  END at the help prompt.  You will then
see the WHAT NEXT?  prompt.
 
Using the COMMAND MENU
 
T/Maker's WHAT NEXT?  prompt can be answered by typing the desired command, or
by using the new command menu.  To use the command menu, type:  C<RETURN> at
the WHAT NEXT?  prompt.  This command menu contains a partial selection of
T/Maker commands.  Type the command's number to use the command.
 
Using the ASSIST Command
 
The ASSIST command allows you to delete, copy, and rename files on disks, as
well check the size of a file or the available space on a disk.  This is
especially helpful if you run out of room on a disk and need to move things
around.  To use ASSIST, type:  ASSIST<RETURN> at the WHAT NEXT?  prompt.  As
with HELP, ASSIST does not harm work which is in progress.  To end an ASSIST
session, type either <CTRL>-Q or <ESC>.
 
Stopping T/Maker
 
To end a T/Maker work session and return to the CP/M prompt (or to FRIENDLY),
type:  STOP at the WHAT NEXT?  prompt.
 
       CAUTION:  T/MAKER DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY  SAVE  THE  LATEST
       CONTENT  OF WHAT YOU ARE EDITING.  THEREFORE BE SURE TO USE
       THE "SAVE" COMMAND BEFORE STOP IF YOU HAVE UNSAVED TEXT.
 
Printer Preconfiguration
 
T/Maker is already configured for all daisy wheel and dot matrix printers in
their normal mode of operation.
 
In addition, T/Maker can take advantage of the advanced features (condensed or
enlarged print, correspondence quality, etc.) of most printers.  We've
included printer configuration files for several printers.  To set up the
proper print.utl file, type:  HELP PR<RETURN> at the WHAT NEXT?  prompt.
T/Maker will present you with an automatic printer configuration menu.  If
your printer is not listed in the menu, refer to the T/Maker Reference Manual
CUSTOMIZATION section.
 
Spelling Checker Dictionaries
 
For your convenience, TMAKER.DIC and EXTRA.DIC have been combined into one
dictionary, in contrast to the description in the Spelling Checker reference
manual.  This has been found to be the most desirable format.
