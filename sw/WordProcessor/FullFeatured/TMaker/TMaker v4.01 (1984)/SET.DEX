Set Example---
 
The SET command executes a series of "rules."  A rule is a numeric or
character equation which may have a logical test associated with it.
SET performs algebra on the fields within a record.
 
The rules below describe the relationships among the different fields
within the customer order record.  It includes sales tax if the customer
lives in California, and determines the appropriate shipping charges.
Amount is Quantity multipled by Unit Price.
