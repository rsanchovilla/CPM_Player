+ 1 C
   1/1 WHAT NEXT?   C        ( C  for COMMANDS)
                   ---
 
        T/Maker can be "MENU-DRIVEN" through the use of the COMMAND MENU.
 
 
        Normally, it is faster to enter Commands via the WHAT NEXT? prompt.
     However,  while speed is important, it is equally important to get
     "up and running" with T/Maker.
 
 
        With the COMMAND MENU, it is not critical to "memorize" the T/Maker
     Commands to get started using T/Maker,  because . . .
 
 
        THE COMMAND MENU PROVIDES A PARTIAL LISTING OF T/MAKER COMMANDS -
                    AND WILL EXECUTE THE SELECTED COMMAND.
+
 
 
 
   REMEMBER:  You can get to the COMMAND MENU at anytime by typing:
                at the T/Maker Prompt:  1/1 WHAT NEXT?  C
                                                       ---
 
 If you can't see the WHAT NEXT? prompt,  type :   <CTRL>Q   to get to it.
 
 
 
 
 
 --> TO GET TO COMMAND MENU NOW, type:   END C   (to End Help Session & goto C)
                                         -----
+ 1 CLIP
   1/1 WHAT NEXT?  CLIP
                   ----
 
        CLIP is a way of MASS DELETING whole chunks of text.
 
        When you Exit the Editor, the line your cursor rests on at the time
   of the Exit then becomes the new "Top of the Screen" line.  You can
   either CLIP everything BEFORE this line or everything AFTER.
+ 1 CREATE
   1/1 WHAT NEXT?  CREATE
                   ------
 
 CREATE allows you to open a new T/Maker File.  T/Maker will prompt you with:
 
   1/1 WHAT FILE NAME?
 
     You may name your file anything you wish.
 
     FILE-NAMES may be up to 8 characters long, with an optional 3 character
   extention.    Example File Names:   Invoices.Jan
                                       Letter.2
                                       BOB
 
 
NOTE:  Anything contained in T/Maker's work space will be REPLACED
       by issuing the  CREATE Command.  That means if you want to SAVE
       whatever work is in the work space, make sure you do a
       SAVE before CREATE-ing a new file.
+ 1 DATA
   1/1 WHAT NEXT?  DATA
                   ----
 
        T/Maker is currently set up to GET and SAVE file from DRIVE B.
 
 
        DATA tells T/Maker a new Disk Drive to GET and SAVE files from.
 
           T/Maker will look for files from the DATA Drive for the entire
           work session unless request a new DATA Drive.
 
 
        You can change the "default" DATA Drive.  See Reference Manual
           under "Customization Notes".
+ 1 DELETE
   1/1 WHAT NEXT?  DELETE
                   ------
 
DELETE erases a file from the current DATA DISK. ("House-Cleaning measure!)
+ 1 DO
   1/1 WHAT NEXT?  DO
                   --
 
          DO will take the line on the  "Top of the Screen" , drop it
   to the WHAT NEXT? prompt line, and execute any Commands on this line.
 
          You may "can" functions using the DO Line concept.  That is,
   if you find yourself always typing the same Commands to do the same
   action to a work file,  you may want to create a new file (called a
   "do file") with the repeated series of Commands as the only line in
   the file.  Then, instead of always having to type a long series of
   Commands, you will only have to type:   GET DOfile DO
+ 1 FILES
   1/1 WHAT NEXT?  FILES
                   -----
 
 
    FILES will show you a listing of files on the specified drive.
+ 1 GET
   1/1 WHAT NEXT?  GET    or    G
                   ---         ---
 
      GET will "get" a Disk File (a file that has been SAVEd on the disk)
           and bring it into T/Maker's work space.
 
 
      If you do not specify a file to GET, T/Maker will ask you:
 
    1/1 WHAT FILE NAME?
 
 
NOTE:  Anything contained in T/Maker's work space will be REPLACED
       by issuing the  GET Command.  That means if you want to SAVE
       whatever work is in the work space, make sure you do a
       SAVE before GET-ting a new file to EDIT.
 
HINT:  If you forgot SAVE before issuing the GET Command, ask T/Maker
       to GET you something you know you DON'T have on disk.
              EX:  1/1 WHAT NEXT?    GET NOTHING
+ 1 HP
1/1 WHAT NEXT?  HELP
                ----
You can get On-Line HELP anywhere without disturbing the current work space.
 
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * After typing HELP, T/Maker will show you the Main Help Menu.
 
 * Type the capital letters of the appropriate TOPIC for HELP in that area.
            TOPICs ARE CAPITALIZED  ( TOPICS are in Dotted Boxes )
 
 * Continue typing the appropriate TOPIC until you get HELP with your question.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
        NOTE:  You can "stack" HELP requests.  For example, if I know I
        want HELP on Searching & Replacing in a text file, I could type:
 
 1/1 WHAT NEXT?  HELP  SR         This avoids viewing 2 HELP Menus in between.
                 --------
 _____________________________________________________________________________
 --->> To view available HELP TOPICS, type:    TOPIC     below.
+ 1 INSERT
   1/1 WHAT NEXT?  INSERT
                   ------
 
      INSERT will "insert" an entire Disk File into the current work space
    at the point immediately above the cursor.  (The line where you
    Exited the Editor.)
+ 1 POSITION
       _____Positioning the Upper Left-Hand Corner of the Screen_____
 
 
        T/Maker can be thought of as a very large ChalkBoard.  Our Screen,
however, is much smaller - thus, we can only view an 80 line X 24 column piece
of the ChalkBoard at any one time.
 
        By typing in the coordinates we would like to view (line # / column #),
we can do massive "hops" around our ChalkBoard from Outside the Editor.
 
 _____EXAMPLES_____
  1/1 WHAT NEXT?   (line#/column#)
 
  1/1 WHAT NEXT?   2/10
 
 2/10 WHAT NEXT?   30
 
30/10 WHAT NEXT?   /1
 
NOTE: The Upper Left-Hand Coordinates are shown left of the WHAT NEXT? prompt.
+ 1 LIST
   1/1 WHAT NEXT?  LIST
                   ----
 
      LIST will allow you to view a disk file without affecting the
          working area.
 
      You can use LIST when you want to view two disk files simultaneously.
          The LISTing can be stopped and started by hitting a key.
+ 1 MERGE
   1/1 WHAT NEXT?  MERGE
                   -----
 
      MERGE will superimpose a disk file on top of the current work space.
+ 1 RENAME
   1/1 WHAT NEXT?  RENAME
                   ------
 
        RENAME will "rename" the current work space.  In a sense, you are
   CREATE-ing a new file, except that it already has information in it.
 
         Because RENAME effectively CREATEs a new file,  you MUST SAVE
   the "new" file if you want to keep it.
+ 1 SAVE
   1/1 WHAT NEXT?  SAVE    or    S
                   ----         ---
 
        SAVE will copy the entire contents of the work space onto disk
    using the name of the current work file.
 
 
    **  Automatic Back-Up Protection:
 
           Upon each SAVE, the previous version will be automatically
    renamed with the file extension: filename.BAK.  This gives you
    automatic file back-up protection after each SAVE.
+ 1 STOP
   1/1 WHAT NEXT?  STOP
                   ----
 
 STOP exit you from T/Maker and send you back to the Operating System.
 
        SAVE will copy the entire contents of the work space onto disk
    using the name of the current work file.
 
 
    **  Automatic Back-Up Protection:
 
           Upon each SAVE, the previous version will be automatically
    renamed with the file extension: filename.BAK.  This gives you
    automatic file back-up protection after each SAVE.
