$EMPTY FILE
		I'm sorry, but my input file
		contains no text.  Perhaps there's
		been some mistake.
$NO FILES
		??  I can't find any file names.
		 Would you write my instruction again,
		 with the file names immediately afterward?
		 Thank you, and I apologize for any inconvenience.
$DEFAULT
		Perhaps something is wrong.
$TOO HIGH
$TOO LOW
$BAD VALUE
		Sorry, I thought that the value
		given in this statement was too
		high (or too low).    So I used
		
$INSTEAD
 instead.
$JUSTIFY ARG ERR
		Sorry, but with "Justify",  I
		only understand "\JC", "\JL",
		"\JR", "\JN" and "\J" types.
		I'm guessing that you want
		"\JN" -- Justifications - None,
		and I hope this is what you
		wanted.
$COMMAND ERR
		Sorry, but I don't understand
		this command.
$TOO LATE
		Sorry, please give me this
		command BEFORE the first line
		of text. I already got started
		and couldn't change if I had to.
$HEADER
$FOOTER
		Sorry.  The total "\H"  header,
		(or "\F" footer), is larger than
		the most recent top (or bottom)
		margin size specified for it, or
		it's larger than 500 characters.
		I'll do what I can, but part of
		it will be missing.
$MISCELLANEOUS
		Sorry, something is awry here.
$READ ERROR
		Sorry, I'm having problems reading
		the disk.  Please try program again.
$WRITE ERROR
		Sorry, I'm having problems writing
		on the disk.  Please try this 
		program again.
$DISK FULL
		Sorry, the output disk you specified
		is overflowing.  Please try again
		with a disk with more space on it.
$FORMATTING COMPLETE
		Successful completion.
