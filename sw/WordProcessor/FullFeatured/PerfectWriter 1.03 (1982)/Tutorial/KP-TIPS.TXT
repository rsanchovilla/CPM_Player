KP-TIPS.DOC

Occasioned by new verson of CP/M from Non Linear Systems, with
KAYPRO3.LRN superseding KAYPRO.MSS and KAYPRO2.LRN.  If there is
NOT a file named  'FORMAT.COM'  and there ARE   two   files   
named    'SETDISK.COM'    and INITDISK.MSS'  then you have the 
new  version  of CP/M.

-README diskette includes the following: 

    'KAYPRO2.LRN' is an  improved  version  of  the  Perfect
    Writer Lesson diskette file named 'KAYPRO.LRN', but not
    formatted for printing.

       'KAYPRO3.LRN'  is  an  improved version of the  Perfect
    Writer Lesson  diskette  file  named 'KAYPRO.LRN' and is
    updated  to  reflect  changes in CP/M now supplied  with
    KayPro II's.

      'KAYPRO.MSS',  is a greatly enlarged version of the four
    page  photocopied  document  concerning Perfect Software that 
    comes  with each KayPro.   Information in this file
    concerning 'FORMAT'  and  'COPY' are addressing  the  CP/M 
    version discussed by the file 'KAYPRO2.LRN'.

    'BATCH.MSS'  discusses  the   process   of   combining
    individual   files   into   single,   larger   documents
    automatically  and with numeric continuity. 

       'NATKUG1.MSS'  is the text file sent  to  the  National
    KayPro Users Group for inclusion in their April/May 1983
    newsletter.  Upgrades  mentioned in this file (and possibly
    others more  recent)  should  be available from your user's
    group or your possibly KayPro dealer.

    'TIPS.MSS'  is an outgrowth of the original  'NATKUG1.MSS'
    file.  As of this version of  the  '-README  Tips'  diskette
    (5/1/83)   'TIPS.MSS'   will   be  a  catch-all   file   for
    miscellaneous tips and suggestions.

This file originated as the end of 'NATKUG1.MSS'. 

RUNNING OFF THE 'B' DRIVE

       C.f. 191K disk capacity of the KayPro II, meaning disc A
full of software:  hence rx. logging to B drive to write.

            This will work with every Perfect Software program
EXCEPT PERFECT FILER.    Do not log onto drive 'b' when using
Perfect Filer. This program automatically transfers from drive to
drive as necessary. 

PW.HLP

            In case you didn't know it, Perfect Writer provides
an on-line 'Help Menu' that will display all of the system
commands.

FORMATTING TO CONSOLE

            Perfect Writer will let you display a formatted
document to the screen before it is printed.  When formatting a
document simply select option 'C' of the formatting menu--"Send
the output to the console device". 

            Your document will be formatted according to the
printer definition 'console' and displayed to the screen.  The
catch here is that 'console' is a definition specifying 10-pitch,
non-proportional spaced printing, with one-inch margins on pages
of only 4 to 6 lines in length. 

Instructions provided for using PFCONFIG to make console output
same as default printer, and using ^S to stop scrolling.

MULTIPLE PARAGRAPHS IN DELINEATING ENVIRONMENTS

            Perfect Writer offers you a number of ways to
automatically number, list or otherwise offset portions of your
text by paragraph.  These commands include 'ENUMERATE',
'ITEMIZE', 'LEVEL', 'DESCRIPTION' and others.  A potential
problem presents itself when one wishes to have more than one
paragraph under a single delineation since the start of a new
paragraph ordinarily informs Perfect Writer it should treat the
following text as a new item.
