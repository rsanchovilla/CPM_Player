			 PW FORMAT TIPS

1	     Spacing associated with NEWPAGE command

To get correct environmental spacing, @NEWPAGE should be followed
by one blank line.   The command may follow end of firstpage text
with no spacing.


2	TO PRINT ROMAN PAGE NUMBERS

@set[page=0]
@pagefooting[center="-@string[conpage=page] @case{
conpage, 1 "i", 2 "ii",	3 "iii", 4 "iv", 5 "v", 6 "vi", 7 "vii",
        8 "viii", 9 "ix", 10 "x", 11 "xi", 12 "xii", 13 "xiii",
        14 "xiv", 15 "xv", 16 "xvi", 17 "xvii", 18 "xviii", 19
        "xix", 20 "xx"}-"]

3	TO KEY PAGE NUMBERS FROM CONSOLE

	     @@PAGEFOOTING(center="@@INCLUDE[con:]")

 During formatting, the program will pause when counting page
numbers and wait for input. Anything can be typed in including
Roman Numerals. Just type a Control-Z at the end of the string to
signal Formatter to continue formatting. 

"Right" and "left" can be substituted for "center" for the
obvious result In fact, they all can be used together as long as
the input is kept brief. ( Perfect Writer reserves a limited
amount of space for each command, so if the strings are too long
they jumble up.)   From Ryan Wilson :- KUTE July, 1984
  

4	RUNNING PP from A>


on running PF from the A> (avoiding MENU) by commands such as

		 A> pp -3 -page 5 b:blahblah.fin

 (Those hyphens are essential, and the information they introduce
must come before you designate the drive and filename ). 

Willard G. Oxtoby, University of Toronto KUTE Sept. l984
(also printing long documents by use of @@INCLUDE.)
