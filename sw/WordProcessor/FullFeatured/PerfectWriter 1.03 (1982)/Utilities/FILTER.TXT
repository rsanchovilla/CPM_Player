	FILTA  -  Filters ASCII	text files.  Removes high order	bits,
		  control characters other than	CR, LF,	FF or TAB.
		  Changes any lone LF to CR-LF.	 Ignores consecutive
		  LF characters.  Option on retaining FF characters.

	FILTB  -  Filters BASIC	files.	Same as	FILTA, but retains LF-CR
		  which	some BASIC editors insert for lines longer than
		  would	normally fit on	a CRT screen.  (This combination
		  is not handled as a normal EOT by BASIC.)


			WARNING:  The next two files remove
				  WORDSTAR "dot	commands".
				  They will also delete	ALL
				  lines	starting with a	period.
			
	FILTW  -  Filters WORDSTAR document mode files.	 Handles CR and
		  LF like FILTA.  Removes dot commands,	retaining FF if
		  desired.  (Optional like on all four programs.)  Also
		  converts "soft hyphens" (1FH)	to normal hyphens (2DH)
		  and "non-break-spaces" (0FH) to normal spaces	(20H).

	FILTWC -  Filters WORDSTAR document mode files.	 Same as FILTW
		  except leaves	all CR and all LF intact in whatever way
		  they originally appeared.



	NOTE:	All these programs retain any FF (form feed) char-
		acters that may	be present.  If	those are not wanted,
		use PIP.COM and	the [F]	option at any time.  If	no
		FF are wanted change the following.  (The three-byte
		address	by-passes the "xx form feeds retained" line.)

				FILTA	03D6  C2  to  C3
				FILTB	03DB  C2  to  C3
				FILTW	044C  C2  to  C3
				FILTWC	044A  C2  to  C3

     These four	programs are written in	assembly language.  They are
considerably faster than the other two programs	included in the	list be-
low.  In addition they provide an excellent summary when finished, with
a typical example shown, using FILTW on	a WORDSTAR document mode file:


     298 input lines read
     276 output	lines with:

	     256 tab characters retained
	     2272 high-order bits deleted
	     162 CTL-characters	deleted
	     22	dot commands zeroed
	     2 form feeds retained
	     9 soft hyphens fixed
	     4 space breaks fixed
	     3 orphan line feeds


     On	this program, FILTW took 16 seconds including the time to show
the summary.  UNSOFT took 43 seconds, but there	is so much disk	activity
the time varied	from 43-61 seconds, depending where on the disk	the new
file was being placed.	PURETEXT took 104 seconds with so much disk ac-
tivity it sounded like something was coming apart.  Both the UNSOFT and
PURETEXT programs did a	warm reboot when complete, the above programs
return immediately to CCP, again minimizing disk activity.


     Other filter programs do not show such a progress report to let the
user know the results -	such a summary will "spoil you forever".  This
series also has	a superior feature over	other filter programs -	only one
name is	needed on the command line, although two can be	used:


	A>FILTW	HELLO.TXT <cr>			(1)
	A>FILTW	HELLO.TXT NUNAME.DOC <cr>	(2)	

	B>A:FILTA HELLO.TXT			(3)
	B>FILTWC A:REPORT.DOC			(3)
	B:A:FILTB A:FILE.BAS C:NEWFILE.BAS	(3)


     1)	normal method.	When finished, renames the original to .BAK
	and the	new file to the	original name.	Saves lots of time.

     2)	makes a	second file called NUNAME.DOC while keeping the	original
	HELLO.TXT file intact.	

     3)	The files need not be on the same disk.
