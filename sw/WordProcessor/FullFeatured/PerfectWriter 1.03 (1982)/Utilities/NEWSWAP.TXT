NEWSWAP allows you to make a new Perfect Writer Swap file of a
different size (larger or smaller) at your convenience.   Menu-
driven, this prg (by Bob Balkwill) cues you what to do.

Put in the Kaypro a "source" disc with an existing PW.SWP file on
it, and a "destination" disc with NEWSWAP.COM and sufficient
space for a new Swap file of the size you require.   Then invoke
NEWSWAP and answer three prompts:

Source swap file:		e.g. A.PW.SWP
How many Kbytes do you want:	e.g. 80
Dest'n swap file:		e.g. B:PW80.SWP

NEWSWAP then creates a new Swap file of the size ordered, which
you can overwrite onto your PW Edit disc.   (If proceeding as
above, one would invoke PIP A:PW.SWP=B:PW80.SWP.) 

This allows you either to have a Swap file as big as the disc
allows, or a smaller one (to allow room for other files on the PW
Edit disc.)

(NEWSWAP works equally well with Perfect Calc, which uses a Swap
file--but PC seems unable to use a Swap file larger than 64K (the
standard or "default" size.)

NOTE also that, because of the use it makes of RAM (volatile
memory) NEWSWAP will not work when you have SMARTKEY, SNAPSHOT or
other utilities "hidden" in RAM.
