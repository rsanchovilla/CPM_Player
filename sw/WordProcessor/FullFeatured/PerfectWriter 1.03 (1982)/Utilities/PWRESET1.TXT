	Redefines the Perfect Writer command 
	<ctrl-x s>, which called (im)Perfect Speller, 
	as a DISK RESET call, to allow disk changes
	while editing.  You can now write or rewrite
	all or part of your text to files of any name
	on as many disks as you like, so long as you hit
	<ctrl-x s> BEFORE each disk change.

	For Perfect Writer version 1.20.

	When this patch is installed, the command
	<ctrl-x s> or <ctrl-x S> sets all on-line disks 
	to read/write status.  The message "Reset Disks"
	is printed on the bottom line of the screen.
	The keyboard click is also turned off (but it
	will be turned on again by the first error bleep
	sent your way by Perfect Writer).

	To write all or part of a file to a new disk:
	change disks, then hit <ctrl-x s>,
	then write the whole file with
	<ctrl-x ctrl-s> or <ctrl-x ctrl-w>,
	or write a marked block with <ctrl-x r>.

	As before, you MUST prefix a filename with a disk
	letter and colon if you are logged to A: and writing to
	B: or vice versa.


---------------PERFECT WRITER PATCH by Peter Brawley

This is my implementation of the patch described in a recent
KUTE newsletter.  It sets all disks to read/write, re-selects
the current disk, and echoes <Reset> on line 24.

The files are

**	PWRESET.ASM	source listing for the patch
**	PWRESET.HEX	hex file for patch
**	PWRESET.SUB	submit file will install patch
**	PWRESET.DOC	documentation


If you wish to modify and re-assemble PWRESET, you need CPMMAC.LIB.

Alternatively, you can do the thing manually with DDT as follows.  
Put on a fresh disc in the A drive holding DDT.COM
					   PWRESET.HEX
					   PW.COM 
Key Control-C and then these commands (only the left column, of
course!)	  

ddt				; loads DDT
f100,9000,0			; clears memory space
ipw.com				; loads and
r				; reads PW.COM
f5ec9,5fc4,0			; clears small chunk of memory
ipwreset.hex			; inserts 
r				; and reads PWRESET.HEX there
g0				; exits DDT
save 137 pw.com			; writes new PW.COM to disc
