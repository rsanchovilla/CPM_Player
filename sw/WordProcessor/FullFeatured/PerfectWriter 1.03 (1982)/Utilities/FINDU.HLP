DOCUMENTATION FOR FINDU v1.00 as of 05/23/84           By S. Kluger

FINDU means "FIND with Unsqueeze"

Usage:   A>FINDU [D:]AFN STRING where

     [D:] is the optional drive designator, 
     AFN is an ambiguous file name, and 
     STRING is a string of characters not to exceed the length of
     the command line or 79 characters, whichever is shorter.

NOTE: FINDU will properly capitalize characters and strip their high bits
so they can be matched by upper case argument strings. This means that
FINDU can be used with WordStar files and others in which high bits are set.

KEYBOARD CONTROLS:

^S	freezes program until any character is typed
^C	immediately aborts to CP/M
^X	immediately skips to the next file (if any)

FINDU OUTPUT:

After opening a file, FINDU displays the file name and, if it is a squeezed
file, the original name. For every match found, FINDU displays the line
number in brackets, in an 8-character field, followed by the capitalized
line in which the match was found. When finished, FINDU displays the total
number of lines scanned. 
