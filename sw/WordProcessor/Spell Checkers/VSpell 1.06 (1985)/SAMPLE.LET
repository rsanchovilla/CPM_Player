Subject:  Availability of Duroplastic for evalutaion


As you may remember from my last sales report, Lunar Products has 
expressed an interest in receiving a sample of our Duroplastic material
for evaluation.  They intend to use it on the Mars Mobile Cruiser that 
is being developed for NASA.  Unless we respond quickly, they may 
purchase from one of our competitors.  I've talked to Engineering and 
they are unwilling to proceed without "executive level" approval.  Can 
you do something to shake this loose?
