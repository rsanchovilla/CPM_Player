This file will be used to provide update information that may
be required between printings of the EDIT reference manual.

Please refer to Section 2 of the manual for information on
installing a working version of EDIT on specific equipment.

When you have a version working on your computer and terminal,
you may run the additional program EDTKEY if you wish to
change the keyboard keys used for specific edit functions.
The program will prompt you how to proceed.

Two changes have been made in the starting (default) functions.
The Line Feed key (CTL-J) now moves the cursor down one line.
CTL-K deletes characters from the cursor position to the end
of the line, and positions the cursor at the next line.
