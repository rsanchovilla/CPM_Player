				PeachText
			  Word Processing System

PeachText is a word processing software package in two parts.  The Editor
creates and revises documents without repetitive typing and corrections.
The Formatter then prints the document according to your specifications on
margins, page length, indentation, etc.  Format commands may be given at
print time or embedded in the text of the document.

variable has a name and a value.  There are several kinds of variables:

		    :Variable.....colon (string) variable
		    =Variable.....equals variable
		    $Variable.....dollar variable
		    #Variable.....number variable
		    &Variable.....length variable

Statements embedded in the text tell PeachText how to use the current
value of a variable.

SET #Variable=n.........Set the numeric value of the variable as n.

		       SCREEN 7 - DATA FILES

FILE and DATA statements tell PeachText where to go to find data and how to
assign the data to variables within the document.  A data file contains logical information in a repetitive structure.

Data files may be either text or fixed length files.  The format of the FILE
and DATA statements differ according to the type of data file.

FILE Tn,DOCUMENT.....Set DOCUMENT as a Text File with n elements per record.
DATA v1,v2,v3........Assign elements in record to variables.
