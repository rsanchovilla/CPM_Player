                      THIS IS THE DOCUMENTATION FOR: 
              BANNER.BAS, POSTER.BAS, BANNER.COM, GOTHIC.COM
                           LIBRARY VERSION 1.0

There  are  four banner programs in this library.  Please  add  additional 
"Banners" as you find them and place them in this library on Mark Howard's 
RCP/M board (315) 446-7793 or,  Computer's Etc RCP/M board (315) 446-7793.  
I  take no credit for these three excellent public domain works,  only for 
the documentation.  

In  all  cases,  the best way of executing these programs is  with  a  dot 
matrix  printer.   Biasing the printer ahead of time is very helpful.   If 
you don't have a method of setting up your Gemini printer,  contact me  at 
(315) 696-5632 after 6 PM Eastern Time,  or at the below listed address. I 
have a very cheap, commercially available printer setup program available.  
It  is the best of the kind there is!   In any event,  a "letter  quality" 
(daisy  wheel) printer will work but there is not the control available as 
with the dotmatrix printers.

In  all  cases,  I have found that the best quality print  is  derived  by 
setting  up your printer ahead of time to 17 Characters/inch,  indented 25 
spaces,  unidirectional  print,  and vertical (between lines) spacing  for 
7/72".   This makes the lines of type just touch and gives the  impression 
of continuous print,  ie the letter "X" will form a continuous chain,  and 
is quite attractive.

                                BANNER.BAS

     BANNER.BAS  was  written in Microsoft Basic and is  very  quick.  The 
letters formed are very large, printed vertically on the page.  BANNER.BAS  
is,  in many ways the classiest of the three.  It was written in Microsoft 
Basic  on a KayPro II computer by Mark Haus of Pittsfield,  Ma.   He is  a 
brilliant pre-teenager.   To run this program, PIP a copy of MBASIC.COM to 
the  same disk as this program.   Then simply type   "MBASIC BANNER"   and 
follow  the  prompts.   He has included instructions (a help file) in  the 
program for running it. Written in 1981, contains 13K of source code.

                                POSTER.BAS

     Size:  19K. Makes block letters.  This program is promp driven and is 
similar  in output to "BANNER.COM" listed below.  To execute this  program 
enter "MBASIC POSTER".  Delivers two different sizes of horizontal banners 
(or posters).  Follow the prompts.  Updated on July 5, 1981 by E.L. Platz.

                                BANNER.COM

     BANNER.COM  Prints horizontally on the page.   This is unusual  in  a 
"Banner"  program,  and  might  more correctly be called a  "Large  Print" 
program.   No,  this  is not the compiled version of  BANNER.BAS.  I  have 
BANNER.COM very useful for large directions, name plates, and headings for 
newsletters.   To run this program, setup your printer ahead of time as in 
the READ-ME file.   Then type "BANNER YOUR MESSAGE".   Try this program at 
half height, 17 Characters/inch on your printer.  You'll be delighted with 
the results. Usually 7 lines high, 7 characters wide. 2K.  Written by Mike 
Horton and Jacque Giraud.

**************************************************************************
                                GOTHIC.COM

     GOTHIC.COM  (11K) Prints vertically on the page (long ways)  in  very 
very large gothic style letters.  Because there is considerable overstrik
ing,  this program takes quite some time to run.   It does, however, print 
very very pretty gothic script.   To run this program,  setup your printer 
as  I have indicated in the BANNER.DOC file that accompanies this library.  
10 characters/inch is sure to be too large,  and the characters will  wrap 
and cause a mess on paper.   Use reduced sized print.  12 pitch will  fill 
the page from one side to the other. To invoke this program, type "GOTHIC" 
The message to be printed will be menu driven. go have dinner.  It'll take 
a bit of time, but it is worth it for "HAPPY BIRTHDAY HONEY" to be printed 
in  this way.   It's destined to become a classic.  It supports both upper 
and lower case letters, unlike most other banners.  I wish I new who wrote 
it.
