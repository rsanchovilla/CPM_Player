Dear \:SALUT\,

     Thank you for your	recent contribution of $\$CONTRIB\ to the Committee to Re-elect	President Lincoln.  We are pleased that	you think enough of the	President to participate in his	campaign in this way.
     We	have always had	strong supporters in \:STATE\, but with	people like you	on our side, we	expect to do even better this time around.
     Thank you again, \:SALUT\.	 If we may be of service to you, we hope you will not hesitate to ask.
