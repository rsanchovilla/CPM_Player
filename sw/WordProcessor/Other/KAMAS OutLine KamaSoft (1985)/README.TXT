This KAMAS Utility Disk contains three files:

READ.ME		This file that you're reading.

UD3DOC.TOP	A separate document topic file that describes the use
		of the new Version 4 UTILITIES topic and the use of the
                MISC UTILITIES topic.

UTILITIE.TOP	A new version (v. 4) of the KAMAS UTILITIES topic that was
		available on Utility Disk 1.  This new version is meant to
		replace the older one.  See the UD3 DOC topic for full details
		on using this new UTILITIES topic.  In general this new
		version loads faster and uses the KAMAS menu mode to access
		the functions rather than adding a new options menu to ROVE.
		This new version also contains new functions that are
		specifically for Version 1.2 of KAMAS.  Version 1.2 of KAMAS
		'knows' about this UTILITIES topic and will automatically
		load it when you start KAMAS.  You need only make sure a copy
		of the topic is in the current KAMAS drive search path.
		If you have room, just copy the UTILITIE.TOP file onto your
		KAMAS Working System Disk.  No install of the UTILITIES
		is necessary.  Version 4 differs from earlier versions of
		UD3 in that it has a new, improved OUTPUTJOB and includes
		a new Job--FLASHCARDS--a learning tool.

MISCUTIL.TOP    A topic containing Misc. System Utilities for KAMAS.  They
                are described in the UD3 DOC topic.  Basically, they are for
                sophisticated KAMAS users who desire to configure KAMAS for
                unique aspects of their system.  For example, configure for
                printer initialization, real time clocks, remote KAMAS
                operation, and generally extend the KAMAS programming
                language for more powerful use.

This disk rests on the cummulative work of many enthusiastic KAMAS users.
If you've got a friend who owns KAMAS, give him a copy of this KAMAS Utility
Disk.  It's an example of the kind of User community we want to foster, and
of the kind of support that the combined leverage of a User Community can
provide.

To print out the UD3 DOC topic and thus get a hard copy of the instructions
for using the Utilities, do the following steps:

(0) Make sure the UD3 DOC topic is available to KAMAS.  On floppy based
    systems this usually means putting this KAMAS Utility Disk 3 in your drive
    B as a data disk.  On Hard disk systems, you will usually want to PIP the
    UD3DOC.TOP file onto your hard disk (to reside with the KAMAS files).

(1) After invoking KAMAS normally, type T (TENV) B (BUILD) at the ROVE prompt
    and then answer with UD3 DOC as the topic name.

(2) Make sure your printer is connected to the computer and turned on.

(3) Type O (OUTPUT) P (PRINT) at the ROVE prompt.

KAMAS will then commence printing the content of the UD3 DOC topic.
When it is done the ROVE prompt will re-appear.

The contents of this Disk are released into the Public Domain provided they
are not sold for profit.

Your comments, suggestions, and application submissions are always welcome.
