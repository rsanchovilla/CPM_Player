	This version of Kermit has been setup to use several features
of the Commodore 128 CP/M+ operating system.  Please understand, I used
the fastest way I knew of at the time to get it running on the 128, which
is using the AUXIN: and AUXOUT: BDOS calls.  I hope to change this to direct
BIOS calls in a few weeks, but I am currently a college student, and have
little or no time.  To use Kermit on the 128, you must have the CPM+.SYS file
dated 4 Dec 85 or later.  Place a SUBMIT file on your disk with the following
in it:

DEVICE AUXIN:=RS232
DEVICE AUXOUT:=RS232

These two lines will connect the 128 BDOS AUXIN: and AUXOUT: to the RS232
driver.  To set the RS232 speed, use CONF.COM which supports the BAUD command
and set the speed to your modem speed.  All these commands can be placed in a
PROFILE.SUB file on you startup disk.
