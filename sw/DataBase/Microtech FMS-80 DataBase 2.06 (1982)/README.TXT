Dear FMS user,
	Here is the first segment of the 3.0 release. 
I hope you will agree with me that it was worth waiting for.
Please read the update material carefully, since many changes
in the software have been completed too late for inclusion in the
main body of the manual.
	Everyone here at DJR has put out a truly heroic effort
to get this release out to you at this time.  We will be updating
it approximately monthly until all of the announced 3.0 features
are implemented.  These updates will be free of additional charge.
	The most exciting experience I've had in a long time was
to create a new file using our new ScreenWriter and the new 
UPDATE program.  It's magic!  Try it!
	Mark Davison wrote ScreenWriter.  He'll be adding to it
over the course of time, and soon you'll be using it to create
reports and menus also.  He has charted a course through the
dangerous waters of my code and his mastery is an inspiration.
	Don Chanfrau has actually managed to make sense out of
the FMS manual.  I'm really pleased with what he's doing, and
I know you will appreciate the improvement over that other
guy -- the programmer, what's his name?
	Barry Weiss continues to crank out copies in 97,000
formats, and even though I change the masters every ten minutes,
and keep saying "Soon, Barry, soon", and we've got back orders
up the wazoo, he's still smiling.  Honest, I just told him 
to wait while I finish writing this, and he gave me a cheerful 
"Ok, Boss."  What a guy.
	Barbara Johnson and Bill Benigsohn have been giving 
us a great reputation for support and applications excellence.  
They're the lucky ones who get to say "Soon, soon" to you 
when you come beating down our doors for the new release.  
They handle you pretty well, don't they?
	Debbie Van Steen keeps us all sane, fed and clothed.
The best den mother we ever had.  
	Glenn Hart is amazing; he makes us all look great in print.  
Glenn created the newsletter, the press releases, and was the
master craftsman of the Comdex show for us.  I've never seen
anybody work so well so untiringly.
	Randi, Judy, Chris, the SuperTemps, and the whole admin
team make our working environment disappear, and that's the
highest compliment there is for support staff.
	So, what can I say?  Jake and I just have the best
team in the world, that's all.  You'll be hearing more from
us.  Have fun with our software - we do!
	I'll be in touch.
