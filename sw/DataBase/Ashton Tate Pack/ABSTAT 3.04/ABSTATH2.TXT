/DBREDBREAD reads selected numeric variables from a dBase II .DBF file 
into the current data set.  Options allow random record or record number
selection.  Format:
        DBREAD in-file
\
/DBWRDBWRITE writes the current data set out in dBase II .DBF format.
Field definition can be specified or a "template" file can be used for
field definitons for all matching variable names.  Format:
        DBWRITE out-file template-file
\
/DEPVEnter a single variable name or number
\
/DATAData related commands are as follows:
CREATE   Create a new data file
FETCH    Read in an existing data file
EDIT     Edit an existing data file
SAVE     Save memory data set on disk file
TRAN     Transform current data set
PULL     Add variables from another file
BUILD    Transform a variable from another file
APPEND   Append data from another file
PRINT    Print data set
RAND     Random number generator
SORT     Sort data set
READ     Read ASCII data file
WRITE    Write ASCII data file
DBREAD   Read dBase .DBF file
DBWRITE  Write dBase .DBF file
\
/DIR Similar to CP/M DIR command. e.g., "B:*.SDF" will show all .SDF
files on drive B.  Entering "*.CMD" will show all .CMD files on 
the default drive.
\
/DESCDESC provides basic descriptive statistics.  The three DESC
commands are:
       DESC  : Mean, Standard deviation, variance, standard
                error of mean, coefficient of variation
       DESC1 : DESC plus median, mode, minimum, maximum, range
       DESC2 : DESC1 plus skewness, kurtosis
\
/EDITEDIT is the function which allows modification of a
data file using keyboard input.  The file must already exist.
To create a new file use CREATE.
\
/EQUA[variable]=expression of variables and constants
\
/FETCFETCH reads in an existing data set from disk for use in
subsequent commands.  The whole data set is read, including any
missing values.
\
/FNAMFile names for data sets and command files are entered
without extensions.  The following extensions are assumed:
   .SDF  for data sets
   .CMD  for COMMand files
Disk drive may be supplied in standard CP/M format
\
/FREQFREQ provides a frequency analysis report.  Standard variable
selection applies plus the last variable selection can be
followed by a blank and a range of values which are to be
listed.  If no range is specified, all values will be printed
