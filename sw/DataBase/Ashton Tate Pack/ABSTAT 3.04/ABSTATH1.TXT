 Commands have been broken into groups:
 
     DATA   - Data manipulation
     STAT   - Statistical analysis
     GRAPH  - Graphic functions
     REPORT - Report writing
     MISC   - QUIT, HELP, COMM, DIR
 
Type "? groupname" for a listing and short description
of available commands.
\
/ANOVANOV1 does 1-way analysis of variance for 2 or more variables.
ANOV2 does 2-way analysis.
\
/APPEAPPEnd loads data from another data set onto the end of
the current data set by variable name.
\
/BARGCreates bar graphs for the specified variables.  Standard
variable selection may be followed by a blank and the range
of values to be included within the graph.
\
/BRGEThe following responses are valid:
     AUTO      Select ranges automatically
     AUTO/n    Break data into n even ranges
     values    Enter the upper bounds of each desired range
               followed by <CR>.
               Up to 50 ranges may be specified.  Follow
               the last range with an extra <CR>.
\
/BUILBUILd allows modifying or creating a variable using an
algebraic expression involving data from another data set.
\
/CONTCONTIG computes Chi Square for a contingency table set up 
as a data set.
\
/CHIFCHIFIT is the Chi Square goodness of fit test on observed 
and expected frequencies entered as variables.
\
/COMM"COMM filename" assigns keyboard entry to a .CMD file.  The
file must contain the keyboard responses to all prompts as they
would have appeared thru normal keyboard entry.  Any errors
encountered will cause the system to revert to keyboard entry.
\
/CREACREATe defines a new data file which can then be updated
from the terminal with EDIT or loaded with data from an existing
file with transforms.  Note: you must reserve space for enough 
variables to accommodate any transforms you may wish to do.
\
/CORRPrints correlation coefficients (r) matrix for all variables.
\
/CONDEach condition is an algebraic expression where the left side is a
variable or constant, equality test is =, <>, <, >, <=, >=,  and the
right side is an expression of variables (in brackets) and constants.
Up to 5 conditions are allowed.  If no more conditions apply, enter <CR>
