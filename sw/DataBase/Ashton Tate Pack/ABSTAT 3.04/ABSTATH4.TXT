/072082
/NUMVEnter the number of variables desired.  The system will 
reserve space for the variables and tell you how many cases are
available.  It will then enter the EDIT function so you can
name the variables if desired and then enter the data.
 
Extra space can be reserved for more variables which can be
later added thru EDIT or transformations by entering "m,n" where
"m" is the number of variables you wish to input thru EDIT and "n"
is the total number of variables you wish to allow for.
\
/PAIRPAIRT produces Student's "t" scores for all variables.
\
/PLOTPLOT will produce a scatter plot.  Both vertical and horizontal
axes can be specified (either variable name or number) and optionally
followed by a blank and a pair of values separated by a comma which
specify the axis limits.
\
/PRINPRINT will print the variables selected, e.g., "*" will
print all variables.  Standard variable selection applies
with the addition of optionally following the last selection
with a blank and "Cm-n" where only cases m thru n will be
printed.
\
/PROBProbability commands are CHI, TTEST, FTEST, POIS, and BIN.
Each command prompts for all necessary input.
\
/PULLPULL adds variables to the current data set from another
data set.
\
/QUITQUIT returns you to CP/M.  Your data set will be lost if
you did not SAVE it!
\
/RANDRAND is the random number generator.  A new or existing
variable can be loaded with either uniformly or normally
distributed random numbers in a desired range of values.
format: RAND <seed>      Optional seed is a large odd integer.
\
/READREAD allows loading the current data set with data from an 
externally produced ASCII file.
\
/REGRREGRression allows one dependent variable and any number of
independent variables.  In addition to a report, the result of the
regression provides for 2 more commands: ESTImate, which will
accept values for the independent variables and estimate the value
of the dependent variable; and RESIDuals which adds a new variable
called RESIDUAL which contains the difference between the dependent 
var minus its estimated value.
\
/REPOReport related commands are as follows:
PON      Assigns report output to printer (132 columns)
PON 80   Assigns report output to printer (80 columns)
POFF     Assigns all output to terminal (80 columns)
DATE     Set date to print on report headings (12 characters, any format)
TITLE    Set title to print on report headings (64 characters, any format)
TEXT     Include documentary text from a file
\
/RFMTEnter AUTO if the file is identical in format to a WRITE with the
variable names.  Or enter the names of each variable to be read separated
by commas; indicate fields which are to be ignored by a comma with no name.
 
Example:   BOYS,GIRLS,,AGE,,,
\
/RGESThe following responses are valid:
      AUTO    Select ranges automatically
      AUTO/n  Break into n even ranges
      m,n     Enter lower and upper bounds of each desired
              range followed by <CR>.  Enter ranges in ascending
              order.  Up to 25 ranges may be specified.  Follow
              the last range with an extra <CR>.
