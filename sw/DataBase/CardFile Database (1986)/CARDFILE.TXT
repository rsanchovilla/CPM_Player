                                    OVERVIEW

             FILE CARD DATABASE is an unstructured database designed  for 
        the  purpose  of keeping any kind of data that would normally  be 
        kept  on  file cards.  It allows the entry of any text  you  wish 
        within  the confines of 16 lines,  each line being 55  characters 
        long.

             Each  file  card  can be "tagged" with as many as  four  key 
        words.  The  key  words are used later for the retrieval  of  the 
        card.  Having  multiple  key  words  allows  for  cross-reference 
        searching, and one or two key words may be used at a time for the 
        search. This approach allows the computer to become a useful tool 
        for the storage/retrieval of file cards which goes far beyond the 
        manual method of storing a single "index" of file cards in a box.

             Cards  may  be printed on 4" x 6" stock so that  a  physical 
        "index"  of file cards may be on hand at  all  times.  Individual 
        cards  may be printed as the cards are entered into the computer. 
        Groups  of cards may be printed at a later time by using the  key 
        words  for selective retrieval.  The entire database may also  be 
        printed at any given time as well.  Multiple copies of individual 
        cards may also be printed.

             Provisions  have been made to copy selected file cards  from 
        one  database to another,  automatically deleting them  from  the 
        original. As the database becomes larger and larger with use, the 
        user  may  elect to extract certain cards,  putting them  into  a 
        special database.  Thus the physical size of any given collection 
        of file cards can be kept to a reasonable size, allowing for more 
        practical  search  and  sort times.  The physical  limit  of  the 
        database  is  250  file  cards,  or "records" as  they  are  more 
        commonly called within the computer industry.

             I have contributed this version of FILE CARD DATABASE to the 
        Public Domain.  If you like it, share it with a friend. Send me a 
        postcard  letting me know.  If it has problems,  or if  you  have 
        questions regarding its use, write me at the following address:

             CAUTION:  Some  printers may have difficulty handling 4 x  6 
        file  cards  without jamming.  When the last few lines are  being 
        printed,  the card may slip, causing the printer to jamb. If  you 
        have  any doubt about this,  you should use continuous-form  file 
        cards.  Provisions  have been made for using either single cards, 
        or continuous-form cards in the printing section of the  program. 
        I  assume  no liability for any damage to printers caused by  the 
        use of this program.  If still in doubt, DON'T USE IT AT ALL.

                                 GETTING STARTED
             For  those who may not be familiar with the terms  generally 
        associated  with  computer documentation,  let me explain  a  few 
        which  you will find here.  The expression <RET> simply means  to 
        hit the "RETURN" key.  Likewise,  <ESC> refers to the "ESC"  key. 
        Control  characters are entered by pressing the "CTRL"  key,  and 
        while holding that down,  one of the letter keys is pressed  too. 
        For example, ^P (<CTRL> P) means to press both the "CTRL" key and 
        the "P" key together.

             You  should never work with an original disk.  If  something 
        should  happen to it,  everything would be lost.  Use PIP.COM  or 
        your  favorite file-by-file copying program and make a  duplicate 
        of  the  files listed below.  If you are not familiar  with  this 
        process,  the  manuals supplied with your computer will tell  you 
        how.

             Copy  the following files from the distribution disk to your 
        working copy:

                       INSTALL.COM
                       INSTALL.DAT
                       MAINBODY.CHN
                       MENU.COM
                       NEWFILE.CHN
                       PRINTER.CHN
                       RETRIEVE.CHN
                       SORTFILE.CHN
                       TEMPLATE.CHN
                       UNDELETE.CHN

             Now,  you  must  decide where you are going to put the  data 
        files.  If  you have a KAYPRO II,  you will have to put the  data 
        files on a second diskette.  All double-sided drives should  have 
        enough  space to keep both the program set,  and the  data  files 
        together.  Hard  drive  users  may  put the  entire  thing  in  a 
        Drive/User area,  or on a diskette run from the C: drive. Be sure 
        that  there  are  no files already in your  selected  hard  drive 
        location  with the same name as any of the above,  or these files 
        will REPLACE them.

             INSTALL.COM  is  used to establish where the data files  are 
        going to be.  Place the program disk in the logged drive, and hit 
        ^C  to "warm boot" the computer.  Enter INSTALL <RET>.  Once  the 
        program has loaded, you will get a screen similar to this:

        =================================================================

                             FILE CARD DATABASE 4.6

                              Installation Program
        -----------------------------------------------------------------
             Installation is simple.  The only consideration is to select 
        the  disk drive where the data files KEYLIST and CARDFILE may  be 
        found.  Some  situations may require that the data files and  the 
        program set reside on the same disk.  Others may be better suited 
        with the program set on one disk, and the data on another. Single 
        sided  KAYPRO  II computers will definitely benefit from  putting 
        the data on a diskette by itself.

             User  areas are not considered.  The programs run  from  the 
        logged drive/user area and the data is put on the drive specified 
        by this program.  If, on a KAYPRO 10, you have the program set on 
        the A7: portion of the hard disk, and you specify the C: (floppy) 
        drive  for the data,  it will be put onto the floppy disk in user 
        area  7.  You  must,  of course be at the A7> prompt to  run  the 
        program.

             Enter  below,  the  drive where you wish to  keep  the  data 
        files.  Typical examples would be B: or C: . Be sure to enter the 
        colon!   Entering <RET> only,  puts the data on the logged drive, 
        along with the program set.

        Enter data drive: __

        Enter a n asterisk (*) to continue...any other key to abort:


        =================================================================

             Follow  the above instructions,  entering the drive of  your 
        choice,  or simply <RET>,  if you wish to keep the data files  on 
        the same disk as the program set.

             Once  INSTALL has been run,  INSTALL.COM may be deleted from 
        your  working copy,  as it should no longer be needed.  The  file 
        INSTALL.DAT,  however,  must  remain.  It contains the drive  you 
        selected with INSTALL, and is read every time the program starts.
        You may change the selected data drive any time you wish,  by re-
        running INSTALL.  If you deleted it, you will need to get another 
        copy from your distribution disk. 

             If you have other INSTALL.COM programs on the same disk, one 
        will delete the other. If this is a problem for you, rename it to 
        anything you wish. The file INSTALL.DAT may not be renamed.

             Now,  we  need some data files to work with.  There are  two 
        ways  to  produce these files.  One would be to transfer the  old 
        data  files from the original version of the program,  the  other 
        would be to create new ones.



                                        4








             If you are transferring your old data files to the new,  you 
        must  have  a copy of the program XFER.COM on your data disk  (If 
        the data disk is the same as the program disk,  that is where the 
        file XFER.COM belongs).

             Place  the  NEW data disk in the logged drive (usually  A:), 
        and hit ^C to "warm boot" the computer.  Place the OLD data  disk 
        in  the other drive (usually B:).  Enter XFER <RET> and wait  for 
        the program to load. You will get a screen similar to this:

        =================================================================

                             FILE CARD DATABASE 4.6

                              File Transfer Program
        -----------------------------------------------------------------

             This  program is used to copy and restructure the data files 
        of  the  original FILE CARD DATABASE program for use  by  version 
        4.6 . The  original version of the program had no version  number 
        displayed at the Main Menu.

             This  program  (XFER.COM) must be on the same disk that  you 
        intend to use as data file for version 4.6 .  It must be run from 
        the  currently logged drive.  For example,  If you are at the  A> 
        prompt then the data disk which contains this program must be  in 
        the A: drive.

             You  will be asked,  now,  for the location of the old  data 
        files.  If the original data disk is in the B:  drive, then enter 
        B: at the prompt. Don`t forget the colon!  It`s not a bad idea to 
        make  a  copy  of your original data files  before  running  this 
        program,  just  in case something goes wrong.  You can`t copy the 
        old files to the new on the SAME DISK!!  If you do, the old files 
        will be erased as soon as you start.

        Enter the original data drive: __

        Now, enter an asterisk to continue...any other key to abort:

        =================================================================

             Enter an asterisk (*) to continue.  Any other key will abort 
        this program.  The data will then begin to copy.  When done,  the 
        bell will ring and a message will be displayed on the screen.

             There  may be a slight difference in the key words once  the 
        files have been transferred. First, they will all be converted to 
        upper  case.  The original key words were allowed to be up to  55 
        characters long. Now the following format will be observed: First 
        key  = 40 characters,  all others = 18.  If any of the  originals 
        were longer than the above specifications,  they will be  chopped 
        off.  You  may choose to go back in,  and re-edit some of the key 
        words. Once XFER.COM is finished, it can be deleted from the data 
        disk, as it will no longer be needed.


                                        5








             If you are going to create new data files,  you will do that 
        from the program's "Options Menu".


                              WORKING FROM THE MENU

             With the program set in the logged drive,  and the data  put 
        wherever you have set it up, you are now ready to begin using the 
        program.  Enter  MENU <RET>.  You will then be presented with the 
        following screen:

                        <ESC>  Quit

                                                     Please select:

        =================================================================

             The choices displayed should be self-explanatory. <A> is the 
        choice  you select when adding new file cards to  your  database. 
        <B> is used for getting the cards back. <C> will print "lists" of 
        cards (More on that later), and <D> gets you the "Options Menu".

             Before  going  any further,  entering <ESC> from  this  menu 
        exits the program.  You should NEVER quit by any other means.  If 
        you do, there is a risk of losing some of your data. Don't remove 
        your diskettes, or turn the computer off, until you have properly 
        "Quit" the program.

             If  this is a "first-time" run,  and you didn't "XFER"  your 
        data  files  from an old version,  you still don't have any  data 
        files  just yet.  Let's make some.  From the  Main  Menu,  select 
        option <D> Other Options.  Enter D (no <RET> key).  You will then 
        get the following screen:

                                                         Please select:

        =================================================================

             The above choices may need a little explanation:

        <1> Display Key Words

             Key words are used to identify the file cards. Without them, 
        the program would not be able to retrieve a "card" from the file.
        Each card may have up to four key words,  and if you are anything 
        like  me,  you may have some trouble remembering the names of the 
        key words you put on the cards.  This option will remind you,  by 
        giving  you a list of all of the key words in use.  You can  view 
        this list on the screen, or dump it to your printer.

        <2> Reuse Deleted Records

             In a real box of file cards,  if you deleted one,  you would 
        simply  pull  it out and throw it  away.  In  this  program,  the 
        process  of deleting records is more akin to replacing  discarded 
        records  with blank ones.  This option allows you to locate those 
        blank cards,  and re-use them without making the file larger.  If 
        there are no blank records available, you will be notified. 

        <3> Create a Template

             Some  of you keep lists of file cards that ALWAYS have  some 
        some  of  the data identical on all of  them.  I'm  referring  to 
        Titles,  headings,  boarder  design,  etc.  A template is a  Pre-
        formatted  form  that is printed onto the card BEFORE  you  begin 
        entering data.  Normally,  this template is blank, and therefore, 
        you don't see it. This option allows you to make a template. Once 


                                        7








        done,  it will appear on all new cards as you enter them. You may 
        change  it  at any time by selecting it from this menu,  and  re-
        editing it.  You may delete it at any time by selecting it again, 
        from this menu, and entering ^Z (the "Clear Screen" command).
         

        <4> Erase the Entire Database

             This  is the option you have been waiting for if  you  STILL 
        don't have any data files to work with. Entering 4 from this menu 
        will create new,  blank data files,  ready and waiting for you to 
        enter your first file card.  Be careful with this option.  If you 
        already have a database,  this option will erase it FOREVER. Once 
        selected,  you  get a warning message,  and you have to enter  an 
        asterisk  (*)  to continue.  This is a safety measure to  prevent 
        accidental  erasure of valuable data.  Any other key  entered  at 
        this point will return you to the Main Menu.

        <ESC> Return to Main Menu

             This option simply gets you back to the Main menu.  You  can 
        toggle  back  and forth between the two menus by entering D  from 
        the Main Menu, and entering <ESC> from the Options Menu.

        <A> Add Records to the Database

             This Main Menu option does exactly what it says. Anytime you 
        want  to put a new card in the file,  you would use this  option. 
        Enter A, and you will get the following screen:

        =================================================================
             
             The  blank card is displayed on the screen with the  current 
        record  number posted in the upper right corner of the card.  The 
        Primary Key Word is boxed off across the top of the card, and the 
        other three spaces for key words are marked off at the bottom  of 
        the card.  The text area of the card is surrounded with a border. 
        The cursor is located at the first space of the Primary Key word, 
        waiting for data.

             Key words will be entered first. Some thought should go into 
        the  use  of  key words.  The way you will be  able  to  retrieve 
        individual cards,  and groups of cards will depend on the way you 
        structure your key words.

             For example, consider a database of recipes for the kitchen. 
        The primary key (Since it is the longest one,  and appears at the 
        top of the card) should contain the NAME of the meal. Meal titles 
        will all be different, so searching by meal title should retrieve 
        only  one  card.  The other key words could then be used  in  the 
        following way:



                                        9








             #2 would contain either BREAKFAST, LUNCH, DINNER, or OTHER.
        #3 would contain food groups,  such as BEEF,  CHICKEN, EGGS, etc. 
        #4 could then be reserved for serving size,  or any other general 
        description  of the meal which would allow you to retrieve groups 
        of records in a specified way that would be useful to you.

             While entering the Key Words, you have the following editing 
        commands available:  ^D or -->, moves the cursor to the right. ^S 
        or <--, moves the cursor to the left. ^Q erases the text from the 
        cursor location to the end of the line.  <TAB> inserts a space at 
        the cursor location.  Text is entered in the usual manner.  <RET> 
        completes  the  entry  of  the Key Word,  and moves  you  to  the 
        beginning of the next key word,  or to the text area of the  file 
        card at the end of entering the fourth Key Word.

             You  must enter at least ONE key word,  or you will not have 
        anything to retrieve your record with.  If you should get a  file 
        card  entered into the database without any key words,  it can be 
        retrieved  by  entering  a couple of blank spaces  for  a  search 
        string,  but  you  may  have to go through a  bunch  of  unwanted 
        records before you find the correct one.

             A  provision has been included to allow you to  easily  skip 
        entering  some of the key words.  If,  for example,  you wish  to 
        enter  only  two,  you  may hit the <ESC> key AFTER  closing  the 
        second key word with <RET>. You will go directly to the text area 
        of the file card.  If you forget, and hit <ESC> instead of <RET>, 
        the following hill happen:  Hitting <ESC> while editing the first 
        Key  word  will have the SAME EFFECT as  hitting  <RET>.  Hitting 
        <ESC>  while editing any of the other Key Words will return  that 
        key word to its original state,  and dump you into the text  area 
        of the file card.

             You may enter Key Words in either upper case, or lower case. 
        They  will all be converted to upper case as soon as you hit  the 
        <RET> key. This simplifies the process of purging identical words 
        from the Key List, and speeds up the sorting too.

             Once in the text area of the file card, you have a number of 
        editing commands available to you to make the chore of typing the 
        text  in easier.  There is a help screen available to you at  any 
        time you are in the text area of the card.  Enter ^V,  and a list 
        of editing commands will be displayed on the screen.  That screen 
        will look something like this:

        Items marked with an asterisk (*) 
        are available when entering key words
        -----------------------------------------------------------------

        Type any key to continue...

        =================================================================

            The ONLY command you really need to remember is ^V (<CTRL> V) 
        as  all of the others are available to you at any time you  might 
        need them.  Typing any key will bring you back to your file card, 
        right  where you left off.  The commands marked with an  asterisk 
        are also available while entering the key words.

             When  you  are done entering text into the  file  card,  you
        request  to  end the edit session by hitting the <ESC>  key.  You 
        will then be asked if the above is correct (Y/N).  If you enter a 
        Y,  the record will be saved to the disk.  If you answer  N,  you 
        will be sent back to the beginning of the edit session (The first 
        Key Word). Any other key will be ignored.

             Once stored away,  you will then be asked whether or not you 
        wish to enter another record. A "Y" will get you the next record, 
        and you repeat the above process.  An "N" will return you to  the 
        Main Menu. A finished card should look something like this:

        =================================================================

        <B> Retrieve Existing Records

             Records  are retrieved by searching for a key word.  You may 
        search  on a single key word,  or if more selectivity is  needed, 
        you may search on two key words at the same time. With the latter 
        choice, only records will be retrieved where BOTH key words match 
        on the same card.

             This  option begins by asking you for the first key word  to 
        search  on.  You must enter SOMETHING.  If you are searching  for 
        blank  key words,  enter a space or two.  You need not enter  the 
        entire key word.  For example,  assume you have the key word FILE 
        CARD  DATABASE  somewhere  within.  You  could  enter  FILE  CARD 
        DATABASE,  FILE  CARD,  FILE,  or even FIL.  You DO need to enter 
        enough  characters  so  that the computer  can  distinguish  your 
        request from all others which may be similar.  Entering FIL could 
        retrieve  FILLER as well as FILE CARD DATABASE.  Entering only  F 
        would retrieve everything beginning with F. In some applications, 
        this  may be handy,  in others it would be a real  inconvenience. 
        The actual use depends on your application of the key words.

             Once  the  first search key has been entered,  you  will  be 
        asked for the second.  If you wish to search on two  keys,  enter 
        the  second.  If not,  simply hit <RET> to ignore the second  key 
        word.  The  screen will then display the key words as you entered 
        them, converted to upper case, and the search begins.



                                       12








             When the first record has been located, it will be displayed 
        on  the screen,  along with a small menu of options available  to 
        you across the bottom of the screen. 

             At this point, you have the following options: 

                  ^D will Delete the record.  It is not actually deleted, 
             but  it  is converted to a blank record,  and  marked  as  a 
             deleted  record.  It will not be accessible with any of  the 
             normal search options as long as it is marked as deleted.

                  ^P will Print the record. Be SURE your printer is "ON", 
             and ready to go, BEFORE issuing this command.  Also take note 
             of  the  CAUTION statement in the OVERVIEW section  of  this 
             manual. Loose cards may jamb in some printers. 

                  ^W will Re-Edit the record. The cursor will jump to the 
             beginning  of the first key word,  and you will  follow  the 
             same  instructions as outlined in the section regarding  the 
             entry  of new cards.  The only exception to this is that you 
             will  not be asked whether or not you wish to enter  another 
             record.

                  NOTE:  After  any  of the above choices,  you  will  be 
             returned to the same record and menu.  You may repeat any of 
             the  menu  options on the same record,  or  perform  several 
             options on the same record.  You do not get the next  record 
             until you ask for it.

                  <RET>  (or <SPACE>) will bring up the next  record,  if 
             there is is another, or it will display a message indicating 
             that  no more records are available which match your  search 
             parameters.  At this point,  you may perform another search, 
             or  go back to the Main Menu.  Entering an asterisk will get 
             you another search, anything else, will take you back to the 
             main menu.


        <C> Print Cards

             This option allows for printing groups of cards.  Individual 
        cards can be printed at the time they are entered,  and  whenever 
        they are being displayed with option <B> of the Main Menu.  While 
        it may be possible to print an individual card with this  option, 
        it  would  occur only if your selective search returned only  one 
        card. 

             The  search works exactly like the one described for  option 
        <B>,  Retrieve Existing  Records. In fact, it uses the same input 
        routine.  There are a couple of differences,  however.  One is if 
        you  don't  enter any key word at all in option <B>,  you  get  a 
        message  that  no key word was entered,  and the  search  aborts. 
        Here,  if you don't enter any key words to search on,  the entire 
        database is dumped to your printer. The second difference is that 
        there is no menu of options displayed between records.


                                       13








             Once  the key word(s) have been entered,  you are asked  how 
        many copies of each card you would like.  Normally this would  be 
        just one per card,  so one is the default value. If you want just 
        one  copy per record,  ignore this question by simply hitting the 
        <RET> key.  Otherwise,  enter the number of your choice, followed 
        by <RET>.

             Be sure your printer is "on", and ready to go at this point. 
        Have  you  read the CAUTION statement in the OVERVIEW section  of 
        this manual?

             Then,  you  are asked whether or not you wish  to pause  the 
        printer between cards, so that you can load a fresh card into the 
        printer before each record is printed.  Answer Y or N. If you are 
        using continuous-form file cards,  and the supply is long  enough 
        to handle the printout, answer N and watch it run. Otherwise, you 
        will be prompted to "Type any key..." before each record, so that 
        you can keep the printer loaded with fresh cards.

             Because  this  option  prints groups of cards based  on  key 
        words  entered,  you  may  wish to print  out  several  "batches" 
        without  having to go back and forth between this option and  the 
        Main  Menu.  At  the end of a print session,  you  can  enter  an 
        asterisk  for another search,  or any other key to go back to the 
        Main Menu.

             This print routine can be aborted by hitting the <ESC>  key. 
        The  best  time  to  do this is either at the "Type  any  key  to 
        continue..."  prompt,  or  while a card  is  being  printed.  The 
        computer checks for the <ESC> key between lines of text.

                                  OTHER OPTIONS

             The   Options  Menu  contains  some  choices  which  in  all 
        probability,  will not be used nearly as often as those listed on 
        the Main Menu. Selecting D from the Main Menu will get you to the 
        Options Menu.

             <1> Print Key List

                  This  option will display the entire list of key  words 
             on   the screen,  or to the printer.  Its usefulness  is  in 
             aiding  your memory should you forget the kay words used  in 
             your database.  It is automatic except that you must specify 
             the where you want the list to be displayed.

                  If  the database is very large,  this option may take a 
             couple of minutes.  I timed a typical list of key words  for 
             172   records,  and  on a 4MHZ KAYPRO,  that took about  two 
             minutes.  On a 2 MHZ KAYPRO,  the same list would take about 
             four minutes.

                  As  the search/sort routine runs,  duplicate  keys  are 
             dropped to make the list more readable. The list is then put 
             into  alphabetical order and made ready for  displaying.  At 
             this  point,  you  enter  either an S,  or a P to  tell  the 
             computer  that  you  wish to send the  sorted  list  to  the 
             (S)creen, or the (P)rinter.

             <2> Re-Use Deleted records

                  As you delete records from the file,  the file does not 
             get  smaller.  The deleted records are blanked and saved  as 
             "Deleted" records.  You can use these over by selecting this 
             option.  The  actual entry of records works just the same as 
             the  option <A> from the Main Menu,  except that you  access 
             deleted records only.

                  You  will  be notified if there are no  more  "Deleted" 
             records to re-use, when the list runs dry. You may exit this 
             option, returning to the Main Menu with the <ESC> key.

             <3> Create a Template

                  Some  people want each new card to come up with certain 
             data already printed on the card.  Typical examples would be 
             Headers,  Titles, Borders, etc. Selecting this option brings 
             you  to  a screen that looks like a typical file  card.  The 
             biggest  difference is that the record number  displayed  on 
             the card is ALWAYS zero.  You may edit only the text area of 
             this card. 

                  Whatever  is on this card will be merged into  ALL  new 
             cards  until  you go back and change the template.  You  may 
             delete the template by calling this option,  and issuing the 
             ^Z command to clear the screen.

                  When  you are through,  you exit this option just  like 
             any  other edit session by using the <ESC> key.  Answer  the 
             "Correct?  (Y/N)"  prompt accordingly.  An "N" will let  you 
             edit it again.

             <4> Erase the Entire Database

                  This option was explained earlier in this  manual.  Its 
             purpose  is to create new data files.  Be careful with  this 
             one,  or  you may lose your data.  Keeping backup copies  of 
             your  data  files  is always a good practice  in  case  they 
             should be accidentally deleted.

                   A  simple way to keep backup copies is to keep a  copy 
             of PIP.COM on your data disk.  After you are finished  using 
             the file card program,  place the Data Disk in the A: drive, 
             your  Backup Disk in the B:  drive,  and issue the following 
             commands:

                  ^C to "warm boot" the computer

                  PIP B:=A:*. <RET>

             the two data files KEYLIST, and CARDFILE will then be copied 
             to the disk in the B: drive.

                      TRANSFERRING CARDS BETWEEN DATABASES

             Sooner  or later,  the time will come when you would like to 
        move  some  of the cards out of one database,  and  put  them  in 
        another.  This  may  occur when an existing database becomes  too 
        large to handle, or full. Other situations might include the need 
        to produce a specialized file of only one type of card, etc.

             Place  a copy of the file EXTRACT.COM on the NEW data  disk, 
        that  is  the disk you will be copying TO.  Put that disk in  the 
        currently  logged drive (Typically A:).  Put the old  data  disk, 
        that   is   the  disk  you  will  be  copying  FROM  in   another 
        drive(Typically B:).  Hit ^C to "warm boot" the  computer.  Enter 
        EXTRACT <RET>. You will get the following screen:

        =================================================================

                             FILE CARD DATABASE 4.6

                            Record Extraction Program
        -----------------------------------------------------------------

             This  program EXTRACTs records from one  database,  deleting 
        them from the original, and puts them into another. It allows you 
        to  free  up space in one database without losing  your  valuable 
        data. EXTRACT.COM must be on the diskette you are copying TO, and 
        it must be run from the CURRENTLY LOGGED DRIVE.

             You will then be asked for the drive which contains the data 
        files you are copying FROM.  Enter A:,  B:,  or whatever drive is 
        appropriate.

             You then enter ONE,  or TWO key words to search on, from the 
        original  file.  The program will extract the records which match 
        the search pattern.

             If the database you are copying TO does not exist,  it  will 
        be created anew.  If it already exists, the records will be ADDED 
        to  the  existing file.  This way,  you can make  several  passes 
        through the old file, adding each pass to the new file.

        Enter the drive containing the old files: __

        Now, enter an asterisk to continue...any other key to abort:


        =================================================================

             Enter  the  name of the drive where the OLD data  files  are 
        located.  Enter an asterisk to continue...or, enter anything else 
        to  abort.  Enter  a  search  pattern just like you  do  for  <B> 
        Retrieve Records, or <C> Print Records. The program will take the 
        selected  records,  and copy them to the new disk.  It will  then 
        delete these records from the old file.
