v0.4  --  lots and lots of fixes!  There was a major  bug  in  my
fseek()  routine  that caused ARK to get sick when  dealing  with
some  files (SYSLIB3.REL, for one).  I have also provided a  real
method  for  allowing date-stamping on any and all  systems  that
provide  either  a clock, or individual file stamps.   Check  the
ARKDATE.ASM  file provided to see how to do an overlay  for  your
system.   Quite  a  few routines have  also  been  given  simpler
methods  of parameter passing (as I drift further away  from  C),
which  should  result in a speed increase.  Since  I  don't  know
where  my  digital watch wandered off to, I  can't  quantify  the
results.
     There is still one major bug that I need to work out:  There
is _no_ error trapping at present to ensure the disk is not full.
There is, of course, an easy way around this: don't do ARKs  when
you don't have the room for them!  (The symptom is ARK gets  very
slow,  and the resulting ARKive is far larger than  sanity  would
suggest  --  this  ARK was 480k until I erased a  few  files  and
started over.)
