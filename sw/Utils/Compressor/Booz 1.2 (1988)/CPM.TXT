booz compiled with Aztec C 1.06D, with BIG option.
Original source in file #6378 on Genie.
Minor modifications by Bob Presswood.

CP/M extraction of individual files implemented, bypassing Rahul Dhesi's
fixfname() function.  This was done by folding the filenames found in the
ZOO file into uppercase in a temporary string, and comparing that temporary
to the file desired for extraction.
