INTRODUCTION:

This program is used to provide a  directory  of  the  contents of  a  .ARJ
archive file.  The companion program, CPMUNARJ, is used  to  extract  files
from .ARJ archives.  

This program was compiled under CP/M Plus.  However, no CP/M Plus  specific
functions are  used, so  it  should  run  under  CP/M 2.2  as  well.  NOTE,
however, that this program will ONLY run on a Z80 processor.


USING DARJ:

The program is used as follows:

     DARJ [du:]<archive>[.arj]

<archive> is the name of the archive file.  If no file  name  extension  is
specified,  the  extension  .ARJ  will  be  assumed.    A  drive  and  user
specifier may optionally be used.  For example, the following command:

     DARJ C3:MYARJ

will open and display the file MYARJ.ARJ on drive  C:,  user  3.    If  the
archive actually has no file name extension, then the file name  should  be
terminated with a full-stop.

If the archive file is found, a directory similar to the following will  be
displayed.  (The data in the last column is really only of relevance to the
full-featured archiving system by Jung).

'Original' and 'Compressed' refer to the original and compressed file sizes
respectively, in bytes.

The second last field, 'Attr', is the file attribute field.   Each  of  the
four columns in this field indicate a file attribute.    This  is  not  the
place to discuss MSDOS file attributes, but, briefly, they are as follows:

     Col. 1 : Archive Bit. 'A' indicates archive bit set, else '-'.
     Col. 2 : System Bit.  'S' indicates a system file, else '-'.
     Col. 3 : Hidden Bit.  'H' indicates hidden file, else '-'.
     Col. 4 : Read Only.   'R' indicates Read Only, else 'W' (read/write).

The last field, with the enlightening name of TPMGVX, gives a  little  more
detail about each file as follows:

     T -> File Type (B = Binary, T = text)
     P -> A '+' indicates path information is available.
	  (Not available from DARJ, nor relevant to CP/M)
     M -> compression method used
     G -> A 'G' indicates file is garbled (encrypted).
     V -> A 'V' indicates archive is continued in another volume.
     X -> An 'X' indicates file is part of a larger file.


NOTES:

DARJ was compiled using HI-TECH C v3.09 for Z80 CP/M.
