Changes for v1.1
================

1. Fixed a bug involving references to non-existent command line
arguments.  This caused v1.0 to be incapable of performing the directory
display function on certain systems.

2. I am including an alternate compilation of the same program in which
console output is substituted for file output, thus achieving a quick
and dirty 'TYPE' program for LHARC member files. Though '[more]' pauses
were added to pause after each screenful of output, I have made no
further attempt to make a 'slick' viewing utility. The alternate version
is called LHVW, and should be safe for RCP/M use.

3. Added standard 'prompt before overwrite' of existing files, a feature
which was absent on the previous version.

4. By special request, the program will now supports ".LHC" as well as
".LZH" as a default filename extension. As before, any filename may be
used if it is fully specified in the command line.

5. Re-wrote the compression ratio calculation code to use integer
arithmetic only. This prevented the necessity of linking the floating
point routines into the program, making the program smaller. The new
version, with the updates, is now under 16k.
