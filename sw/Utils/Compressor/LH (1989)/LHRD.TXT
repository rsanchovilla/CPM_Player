This is the first release of a CP/M utility which will list and/or
extract member files of archives created by new compression program
LHARC, introduced here last month from Japan.  LHARC is currently
available only for MS-DOS. The files can usually be recognized by the
characteristic filename extension ".LZH".

LHARC is based on a public domain 'C' program called LZHUF, which is in
turn an enhanced version of a simpler scheme called LZSS. LZSS was
originally coded by Haruhiko Okumura, who has also taken the time to
explain the various programs. The enhancement was the work of Haruyasu
Yoshizaki, who is also responsible for the LHARC itself. The 'C' code
was translated to English by Kenji Rikitake. Special mention is also due
to Kenjirou Okubo, a central figure in the exchange.

This program is based on the LZHUF 'C' code, which was split in half and
otherwise modified to compile under CP/M by Gene Nolan. I made
appropriate modifications and additions to make the program work with
LHARC format files.  The program was compiled with Aztec 'C' v1.06D.
Type the program name for a simple usage message.

I plan to make some additional enhancements and neaten up the 'C' source
for inclusion in a subsequent release, hopefully very soon. Thanks again
to everyone involved.
