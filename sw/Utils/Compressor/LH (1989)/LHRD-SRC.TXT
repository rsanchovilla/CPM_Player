This is the most recent 'C' source code for the LHRD program, which is
used to display the directory contents and/or extract selected members
from .LZH archives created by the MS-DOS program LHARC.

The source can be compiled for either CP/M (using Aztec 'C' v1.06D) or
MS-DOS (using Microsoft 'C' v5.0).   Furthermore, and can be  compiled
to  generate  either an extracting version or a "view  only"  version.
For  details  on  the above, see the notes at  the  beginning  of  the
source.   I am currently too busy on other projects to do further  en-
hancements to this program at this time, so any interested parties are
welcome.  There is apparently a problem with the current version  when
extracting large (> 100k?) files (system may hang); if anyone can find
that problem please let me know what it is (or better yet fix it!);  I
do  not  have any effective way of debugging compiled 'C' code  at  my
disposal.

Any other fixes or enhancements are welcome as well; simply make  them
and re-release the improved version.
