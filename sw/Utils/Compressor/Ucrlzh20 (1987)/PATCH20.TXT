------------------CRLZH/UNCRLZH v2.0 Patch Information--------------------

Time/Date stamping patch areas:
   In addition to the 'standard' patching areas that are accessable with ZCNFG 
   or via the overlay file provided, there is space available in the v2.0 
   release modules for the addition of user-defined patches for time/date 
   stamping (or whatever other kind you like) patches.  These areas are:

      CRLZH:                      2000-20FF        
      CRLZH (Z-System version):   1E00-1EFF
      UNCRLZH:                    2400-24FF
      UNCRLZH (Z-System version): 2200-22FF

   Note that these areas are "beyond" the provided .COM's address range 
   (for example, if you load CRLZH under DDT the 'NEXT' address will be 
   1F00).  Not to worry: the patch areas are just past the UNINITIALIZED 
   (and, hence, unloaded) data areas.  The patching loader MLOAD (for .HEX 
   files) and RMLOAD (for .REL files) are capable of handling patches which 
   'extend' the .COM files being patched.
