Version 2.0 of LZH encoding compresses more than version 1.x and is about 10% 
faster.  UNCRLZH will handle BOTH versions of LZH compression.  To decompress, 
you must first extract all of the files in this library via NULU or some other 
such library utility.  The file UCRZLH20.COM is uncompressed and will decode 
all of the files that are compressed.  Merely use the command:

    UCRLZH20 *.?Y?

Z80s only.  However, there's LT to handle LZH decoding and a program based on 
FCRUNCH for LZH encoding.  Look for those if you require 8080-only opcodes.

MOST of the code and docs are based on CRUNCH and UNCRunch.  Any typos 
you find are yours to keep (that is, in modifying/reading/updating the 
large volume of existing docs for LZH, I undoubtedly have left behind 
some amusing and/or frustrating half-sentences and such...sorry).
