CRLZH and UNCRLZH v2.0 are new releases of the LZH algorithm merged with 
updates to the CRUNCH programs (thru v2.8):

1) A new encoding algorithm is used.  This new algorithm COMPRESSES FURTHER 
   than v1.1.  The UNCRLZH v2.0 program can detect files encoded with the 1.1 
   algorithm and can automatically select proper decoding method.

2) The LZH algorithm has been extensively re-coded for speed.  Test cases have 
   shown decreases in compression time of 10% or more (times vary with type of 
   material being compressed).

3) The file limit has been changed back to 256 to reduce run-time space 
   requirements.  If this is a problem, the limit can be changed by the user 
   with re-assembly of the file(s).

-----------------------CRLZH/UNCRLZH v1.0 notes follow---------------------

CRLZH and UNCRLZH v1.1 are virtually identical to their 1.0 versions (the 
Beta test versions) with the following exceptions:

1) The version number placed in the LZH-Encoded file (part of the header) 
   is now 11h instead of 10h (for 1.1 vs 1.0).  Other than that minor 
   detail, the files produced by this official release and the Beta test 
   will be identical.  (Files produced with the Beta version are acceptable 
   to UNCRLZH v1.1).

2) The CRLZH program is marginally faster.  Some small speed enhancements 
   were made, but the algorithm is intrinsically slow.

3) The UNCRLZH program has been changed to default to the file extension 
   .?Y? when the extension .* is used (see CRUNCH 2.4 notes, below, under 
   the heading: 4. DETAIL INVOLVING FORCED "?Z?" EXTENSION [UNCR only].) 
   This means that to UNCRUNCH all ?Z? files, you must use .?Z? rather than 
   .* (.* will only find .?Y? files).  HOWEVER, the character used has 
   been made a configurable item (see patch information), so you can tailor 
   it for your preference.

4) The display format differs slightly (a few extra CR-LF sequences).

-----------------------CRLZH/UNCRLZH v1.0 notes follow---------------------

CRLZH and UNCRLZH v1.0 (Beta test versions) are based upon S. Greenberg's 
CRUNCH and UNCRunch programs (v2.4).  The intent was to provide a user 
interface identical to existing programs (similar function - similar 
interface).  CRLZH and UNCRLZH differ from Steve's programs in the 
following areas:

1) CRLZH makes files with a 'Y' in the extension (as opposed to 'Z').  The 
   UNCRLZH program recognizes this as the extension for LZH encoded 
   files.

2) CRLZH progressively changes the file extension of the crunched file, 
   allowing for a bit more user insight into the original file name.  It  
   operates upon file extensions as follows:

      BLANKS - converted to .YYY
      .123   - converted to .1Y3
      .?Y?   - converted to .?YY
      .?YY   - converted to .YYY

There was no reason to tamper with the format CRUNCH uses on the output 
file.  Therefore, with the exception of taking the 'next' file type in 
sequence (SQueezed files begin with a 76h,FFh sequence; Crunched files with 
76h,FEh; so LZH encoded files begin with 076h,FDh) and setting the revision 
levels in the header to 1.0, there's no difference in the output file 
format.  You can probably coax your time/date stamping into operating 
on LZH encoded files.

UNCRLZH preserves the capability to operate on CRUNCHED and SQueezed files, 
so you can use it on your system as a replacement for UNCR.  There were no 
changes to these features (Uncruncing and Unsqueezing was supplied in .REL 
file form) so fear not!  The driving program was altered ONLY to recognize 
the additional file type and branch to the new decompression code (version 
number and sign-on message text was altered, too...but that's trivial.)

Since these programs are BASICALLY CRUNCH v2.8 and  UNCRunch  v2.8, the user 
interfaces are the same.  The the version 2.3 internal revision information 
in the CRUNCH program has been preserved so that the program can be 
configured by the same programs (if any exist).

     +--------------------------------------------------------+


Version 2.8 -- May 5, 1991 -- Gene Pizzetta
     Fix one bug and create another!  But this one is very minor: 
     if the file was copied (rather than crunched) the date stamp 
     was written to the destination file twice.  And if the A 
     option was used, the  archive attribute was set twice on the 
     source file (the latter dates from version 2.4).  Thanks to 
     Howard Goldstein for finding that one.

Version 2.7 -- April 27, 1991 -- Gene Pizzetta
     Implemented Bruce Morgen's suggestion for a ZCPR3-only 
     version that would allow UNCR to be smaller than 8K and 
     still uncrunch LZH files.  In the ZCPR3-only version the Z80 
     CPU test is replaced with a Z-System check.  Also fixed a 
     bug: Bruce Morgen reported that CRUNCH with the A option 
     failed to set the archive attribute on the source file if 
     the destination file was in a different user area.  Putting 
     the call to DATSTP after the call to ARCIT fixed that 
     problem.  Howard Goldstein reported that if either program 
     aborted because of insufficient memory, an arbitrary number 
     of "files processed" was displayed.  The file count is 
     initialized later in the code, but zero files is now 
     displayed in that case.  Minor screen format corrections: 
     "[ file empty ]" message was flush left, instead of one 
     space in, as it should have been; and the disk change prompt 
     was being overwritten by the next file crunched, for lack of 
     a carriage return/line feed.  ZMAC/ZML instructions added to 
     TEC file.

Version 2.6 -- March 26, 1991 -- Gene Pizzetta
     Failure to initialize TRPFLG for each file sometimes caused 
     an extra null code to be inserted near the beginning of the 
     crunched file.  This bug in no way affected the validity of 
     the crunched file.  Also failed to include an LZH equate in 
     CRUNCH.Z80 after adding LZH uncrunching to UNCR.

Version 2.5 -- March 21, 1991 -- Gene Pizzetta
     When running under ZSDOS, now copies the source file date 
     stamp to the output file when crunching, uncrunching, or 
     just copying.  In addition, the date stamp is stored in the 
     header of the crunched file, in the same manner as the 2.3D 
     versions.  UNCR gives priority to the embedded date stamp, 
     it it exists, for the output file.  In either case the 
     current date will be used as the access date.  If the modify 
     date is blank (a non-standard condition), it will be 
     supplied from the create date.

     New S option toggles between including and excluding system 
     (hidden) files.  As distributed, system files are excluded 
     by default.  The old O option has been renamed the E option 
     (erase existing files), and the old C option has been 
     renamed the I option (inspect mode), for compatibility with 
     other standard ZCPR3 utilities.  The old options still work, 
     though, for those who have become accustomed to them.

     Now handles up to 512 matching files, if an ambiguous 
     filename is given.  (The number of files can easily be 
     increased, if anybody has need for it.)  Version 2.4 could 
     handle 256 and version 2.3D only 127 matching files.

     UNCR now uncrunches LZH-encoded files, using the R. Warren's 
     UNLZH.REL module.  It checks the header of LZH files for an 
     embedded date stamp, although no LZH cruncher inserts the 
     date at this time.  Nevertheless, we're ready if it ever 
     happens.

     Screen displays have been compacted somewhat to allow 
     display of more filenames on the screen (twice as many in 
     quiet mode).  High bits are now filtered when displaying 
     filenames so you won't see weird characters.  (For UNCR the 
     quiet mode screen looks the same, no matter what kind of 
     file is being decompressed.  Each file takes a single lines, 
     unless it's a direct copy.)

     Under ZCPR3 the command processor parses the filespecs, so 
     all permissible user areas are available.  Under ZCPR33 and 
     above, invalid directory specs will generate an error rather 
     than defaulting to the current directory.  The usage screen 
     will also reflect the actual name of the COM file, even if 
     re-executed with the GO command.

     All options are configurable as the default operating mode.  
     The usage screen now reflects the current effect of the 
     command line options, if they are used.  All configuration, 
     including CRUNCH's exclusion list, can be done with ZCNFG.  
     The same CFG file is used for both CRUNCH and UNCR, but some 
     configuration options are not effective for both programs.  
     See the ZCNFG help screens for full details.

     Other changes:  If the original file already has a "Z" as 
     the middle character of its filetype (for example, "AZM"), 
     CRUNCH will now change only the last character of the 
     filetype to a "Z", unless that character is also already a 
     "Z".  If either program is aborted with a ^C, the partial 
     output file will be closed and erased, so zero-length files 
     will no longer be left behind.  Incorporates routines from 
     version 2.3D that traps and alters any occurrence of the 
     command mode sequence used by Telenet and PC-Pursuit, so 
     file transfers will not be aborted on those systems.  CRUNCH 
     now recognizes LZH encoded files as already crunched.  
     Various messages have been added or altered to be more 
     specific or for aesthetic reasons.

     This version is a direct descendant of version 2.4.  Other 
     than the TRAPIT routines, none of the version 2.5 code comes 
     from the various 2.3D versions, although those versions 
     originated the embedded date stamp idea incorporated herein. 
     Many, many thanks go to Howard Goldstein for his ideas, his 
     help, and his bug finding skills.

Version 2.4 -- September 15, 1987 -- Steven Greenberg
     CRUNCH and UNCR 2.4 process and generate files identical to 
     version 2.3 (except embedded revision level byte), 
     regardless of mode of operation.  A few very observant 
     people noticed that v2.3 could output valid (but different) 
     files when running in "quiet" mode.  The output of v2.4 
     should be identical to v2.3 running in verbose mode, except 
     for the embedded revision level byte.  Some changes were 
     made in the implementation of the "core" of the algorithms 
     for both CRUNCH and UNCRunch -- in the case of CRUNCH, 
     conditionals were removed by splitting into three separate 
     loops.  In the case of UNCRunch, an unnecessary chase to the 
     end of "virtual links" was eliminated by aborting the search 
     as soon as an available reassignments lot is found.  Other 
     performance improving changes include less time updating the 
     screen and dynamic I/O buffer sizing.  Non-time-critical 
     "user-interface" changes (e.g., the "tag mode" code, etc.) 
     were coded in as straightforward a manner as possible, with 
     little regard to code space minimization and even less to 
     speed.  The great majority of the changes are user interface 
     related:

     A new option lets you select any number of files from a 
     group for processing.  After all the selections have been 
     made the files will be processed.  Selections are presented 
     and processed in alphabetical order.

     If CRUNCH ever creates a file larger than the original, the 
     file will automatically be erased and replaced with a direct 
     copy of the original.  If the original is already crunched 
     or squeezed, or if the filetype matches a user configurable 
     exclusion list, such as .LBR or .ARC, a straight copy 
     operation will be substituted.  Thus all specified files 
     will be transferred in the most efficient manner, 
     facilitating the use of CRUNCH for the creation of .LBR's or 
     as a backup utility.  Similarly, UNCR will either uncrunch 
     or direct-copy all specified files for full restoration.

     If CRUNCH or UNCR fills an output diskette during a wildcard 
     operation, the last (partial) file will be deleted and the 
     user will be prompted to change diskettes.  Operation will 
     then continue, starting with that last file.

     UNCR and CRUNCH take as many as three or four (respectively) 
     command line options, in any combination.  Each option 
     corresponds to a mode which can be set to default to an 
     user-defined state.  The command line toggle will then flip 
     the state back on or off.

     The archive mode toggle, when turned on, will only crunch 
     files that have changed since they were last backed up 
     (based on the CP/M directory archive bit).  When running in 
     this mode each input file will be flagged as archived as 
     soon as the crunch operation for that file has completed.  
     The "prompt before overwrite" mode toggle allows command 
     line control of whether the program stops to warn you each 
     time it is about to overwrite a file with the same name.

     UNCR now also unsqueezes as an added convenience!  Usage is 
     identical.  UNCR will automatically recognize the file's 
     format and use the appropriate algorithm.

     Modest speed improvements have been made through a variety 
     of techniques, including more data buffering to reduce disk 
     activity.  The extended buffers are dynamically allocated to 
     take maximum advantage of currently available memory on your 
     system.

     Messages inform you when the programs are crunching, 
     uncrunching, unsqueezing or copying and why (e.g., "Already 
     crunched" or "Zero length").  Includes the old in, out, and 
     compression ratio reports as well as a final figure on the 
     total number of files processed.

     Current program constraints limit wildcard operations to a 
     maximum of 255 files.  Hitting ^C will entirely abort either 
     program immediately.  Although probably of limited 
     usefulness, ^S will pause the programs (in verbose mode).  
     ^W will then resume.

Version 2.3D3 -- August 25, 1989 -- Howard Goldstein
     This version fixes a bug which resulted in failure to 
     recognize a datespec if a destination du was entered.  
     Changes in the COMMON routines fix problems concerning the 
     correct drive for the !!!TIME&.DAT file when running under a 
     non-ZCPR3 system.

Version 2.3D2 -- November 7, 1988 -- Carson Wilson
     Previous versions set the UNCRUNCHed file's Last Access 
     stamp to the Last Access stamp of the original file.  This 
     version sets the Last Access stamp of UNCRUNCHed files to 
     the current time and date if a DateStamper compatible clock 
     is available via BDOS function 12 (Return Version).  All 
     changes are to this file and are marked "2.3D2" for 
     reference.

Version 2.3D1.1 -- August 2, 1988 -- Carson Wilson
     Changes in COMMON.LIB:  Replaced 8080 opcodes with Z80 
     opcodes for Z80ASM.  Added code to close !!!TIME&.DAT file 
     at label RETCCP:.  This was the only way to ensure that the 
     file is always closed and set to R/O.  T&D file is only 
     closed if we were writing to it.  Modified CLOSTD and OPENTD 
     to preserve the T&D file's original archive bit.

Version 2.3D1 -- July 20, 1988 -- Carson Wilson
     UNCRUNCH version 2.3D did not set the !!!TIME&.DAT file to 
     read/only on exit.  UNCRUNCH v. 2.3D1 corrects this error.  
     The version name was decided upon to avoid confusion with 
     UNCRUNCH version 2.4, which adds several features not 
     available in 2.3, but does not support DateStamped files.  
     UNCR23D1 is released with the approval of Bridger Mitchell, 
     author of UNCR23D.  CRUNCH23D remains unchanged.

Version 2.3D -- March 14, 1987 -- Bridger Mitchell, Plu*Perfect Systems
     CRUNCH and UNCRUNCH support DateStamped files.  CRUNCH 
     includes the original file's datestamp data in the header of 
     the crunched output file.  UNCRUNCH v2.3D uses these data to 
     replace the datestamp of the uncrunched file after it has 
     been closed.  This means that the uncrunched file will have 
     its original time and date.  CRUNCH also supports an 
     additional optional field -- a datespec -- which may be used 
     to specify a temporal class of files to crunch, for example, 
     all files more recent than a specified date and time.

     CRUNCH now monitors the output for the first two bytes of 
     the sequence: 00dh, 040h, 00dh (with hi bits possibly set).  
     If detected, it inserts the CRUNCH NULCODE.  This prevents a 
     crunched file from triggering Telenet/PC-Pursuit's command- 
     mode, which can abort a file transfer.  Code is derived from 
     C. B. Falconer's CRN v2.5., 86/12/19.

Version 2.3 -- November 15, 1986 -- Steven Greenberg
     The core of this source code is pretty much unchanged since 
     the original conception and refinement of CRUNCH v2.0.  
     Though attention was made in selecting an algorithm which 
     could be implemented in a relatively efficient manner, and 
     some care was taken to keep the 'innermost' loops fairly 
     streamlined, there is no doubt room for improvement in terms 
     of the optimally efficient implementation.  This simply 
     means that future releases may run even faster than the 
     current one.

     The programs now can be configured for ZCPR use.  To support 
     the Z3 environment descriptor, the patch byte locations have 
     been shifted up.  If you are going to be patching these 
     bytes yourself, refer to the new PATCH23.DOC, included.  
     (Note: while the location of these bytes has changed, their 
     function has not).  If you are going to use the install 
     program CRINSTAL.COM, just make sure to use v2.3 of that 
     program, included.  If you make a mistake and use the wrong 
     install with the wrong program, you will simply get a 
     "Invalid or Incompatible CRUNCH.COM" or some similar 
     message.  Usage of v2.3 is identical to that of v2.1.

Version 2.2 -- November 3, 1986 -- Steven Greenberg
     This library contains version 2.1 of the CRUNCH and UNCRunch 
     data compression utilities.  CRUNCH21.LBR, as originally 
     released, contained an installation program CRINSTAL.COM.  
     This was created as a last minute after-thought, because the 
     number of available "patch bytes" was getting out of hand 
     (also past experience has shown that people tend to ignore 
     patch bytes, which is understandable).  Unfortunately, the 
     last minute nature of the program (and its apparent 
     simplicity) allowed it to slip by normal multi-system, pre- 
     release testing channels.  While the install program worked 
     fine under CP/M 3, it worked only on CP/M 3.  I don't know 
     why DRI chose to change the operation of low# system calls 
     (namely "6"), but the bottom line is that the program would 
     not accept any input as a "Yes" response, including the 
     answer to the question "Do you want to continue?" (This made 
     the program quite difficult to run).

     Though it has been less than 24 hours since the release of 
     CRUNCH21.LBR, their is no recalling in this "business" (I 
     use the term loosely).  CRUNCH22.LBR contains a modified 
     CRINSTAL v2.2 (which uses good old fashioned BDOS #1 calls).

Version 2.1 -- November 2, 1986 -- Steven Greenberg
     Main change from version 2.0:  Provides full "DU:" support 
     for source and destination files.  Drive, User, neither, or 
     both in either order will be accepted for either the source 
     or destination.  Particularly useful for backup (e.g., 
     "CRUNCH <file> B0:") when working with a hard drive.  The 
     display format has been correspondingly updated to always 
     show source and destination drive and user codes, whether 
     they are specified or not.

     You can now type CRUNCH *.* or UNCR *.* in mixed groups of 
     files and get the desired results.  CRUNCH *.* will 
     automatically not attempt to crunch files which are already 
     crunched (or squeezed!).  This decision is made after 
     opening the input file and analyzing the first few bytes, 
     not by using the middle letter of the filename extension (so 
     .AZM files, etc.  will still be crunched).  This complements 
     the UNCR v2.0 feature of only uncrunching crunched files 
     when *.* is specified, though that is achieved more 
     expediently by filename extension analysis.

     Error recovery:  Put half a crunched file in, get half an 
     uncrunched file out!  While this is not a recommended mode 
     of operation, it is illustrative of a somewhat more 
     intelligent handling of various error conditions.  If errors 
     are detected within a crunched file, the maximum amount of 
     information accumulated will be written and the file closed. 
     Furthermore, almost all errors pertaining to a single file 
     will not result in an abort of the entire wildcard operation 
     -- the program will continue with the rest of the files.  
     Major errors, (e.g., destination disk full), will of course 
     abort the whole operation.

     Minor changes were made to provide more useful error 
     messages (e.g., "Disk Full" for disk full, and "Output 
     error" for other, less common output related errors.  The 
     usage message has been significantly expanded:  type CRUNCH 
     or UNCR with no filename specified to see it.

     Corrected a one count error on input records displayed when 
     uncrunching a version 1 crunched file with the version 2 
     program.  Big file fans:  an extra decimal place provided on 
     the final input K ---> output K to correctly display file 
     sizes even if they exceed 1 megabyte.  Note that all four 
     "running displays" are in 4 digit fixed format fields, and 
     will loop back to zero after 9999.  This is not too uncommon 
     on the "cr" column, and would happen on the input or output 
     recs columns if a file size exceeded 1.25 megabyte.  This is 
     nothing to be concerned with.  Certain other very technical 
     internal corrections have been made -- it is recommended 
     that you replace your version 2.0 programs with these 2.1 
     versions to maintain utmost reliability under all possible 
     circumstances.

     The "running displays" update slightly less often now when 
     crunching, as it was determined that a non negligible amount 
     of time was being wasted updating the screen.  It may appear 
     CRUNCH is running slower, but rest assured it's actually 
     running faster.

     More user configurable options, plus an install program!  A 
     provision to eliminate the 'Result not smaller than 
     original.  Save it anyway?' question has been provided.  
     When this situation occurs, it is often on very small files 
     -- some people prefer unattended wildcard operation which 
     will not stop to prompt for user input, even if at the 
     expense of a few extra resulting records.  This, along with 
     three other options provided as "patches" in v2.0 ( 
     "Quiet/Verbose", "Prompt before overwrite", and "Defeat 
     multi-sector I/O" [see accompanying TURBODOS.WRN for a full 
     description of that one]) can now be quickly changed (in 
     CRUNCH and UNCR simultaneously) by running CRINSTAL and 
     answering a few self-explanatory questions.  See 
     CRINSTAL.DOC for simple instructions on how to fire up this 
     installation program.  (Note to more technical users: the 
     one byte patches can still be made using a debugger.  A few 
     additional patches, which the install program does not 
     support, can be made as well; these are probably only of 
     interest to more technical users anyway).

     made possible thru use of Jim Lopushinsky's "PARSEFCB.REL" 
     module.  Many thanks to Paul Foote & Richie Holmes who have

Version 2.0 -- September 2, 1986 -- Steven Greenberg
     CRUNCH v2.0 embodies all of the concepts employed in the 
     UNIX COMPRESS-ARC512 algorithm, but is additionally enhanced 
     by a "metastatic code reassignment" facility.  The code 
     reassignment is augmented with a refined incremental 
     compression ratio analysis for adaptive reset.  This 
     provides additional improvement, especially on files with 
     certain structural variations.  (It is ironic to note that 
     if the file ARC512.EXE is CRUNCHed, the resulting file is 
     nearly 14% smaller than the file produced when that program 
     is used to compress itself).  Although short files will 
     generally produce the same results as the above mentioned 
     utilities, CRUNCH saves a few extra bytes by eliminating 
     zero fill between code length changes.  Other improvements 
     include:

     Use of multi-sector I/O when running in a CP/M 3.0+ 
     environment (automatically selected when appropriate).  May 
     be permanently deactivated if desired.

     Relaxed restrictions on filenames (e.g., files with a "Z" as 
     the middle extension character, such as .AZM files, are not 
     a problem).

     Improved wildcard operation -- non-critical errors will 
     abort only the current file, not the entire operation.

     "Verbose" and "Quiet" modes of operation.  The former gives 
     full running progress reports while compressing, including 
     number of input and output records, compression ratio, 
     "codes assigned" and "codes reassigned".  Although some of 
     this information has limited usefulness, it is amusing to 
     watch.  "Quiet" may be preferred when using slow (or 
     printing) terminals, and will allow the results of up to 24 
     wildcard operations to remain on the console.

     Optional prompt before erasure of pre-existing files.  A 
     warning will be issued if an existing file is about to be 
     over-written.  This feature can be deactivated if desired.

     Full compatibility with all crunched files.  UNCR 2.0 will 
     uncrunch all "crunched" files, regardless of which version 
     of CRUNCH was used to create them.  CRUNCH v2.0 will always 
     use the improved algorithm to create new files.

     "Confirm" mode of operation.  Used in conjunction with a 
     wildcard filespec, this option allows selectively crunching 
     or uncrunching a subset of all files matching the spec.  The 
     user will be prompted (Y/N) for each file matching file; a 
     response of "N" will simply move on to the next file.

     Continuous checking for ^C abort.

     Inclusion of a "NOP" code.  In addition to the normal 
     special EOF and RESET codes, the new structure sets aside 
     two additional codes as reserved (one "NOP", one "SPARE").  
     The "NOP" code can be inserted into the data stream at any 
     point and will always be ignored by the uncruncher.  One 
     possible use of this would be a "Telenet Trap" -- where the 
     CRUNCH program would monitor its output and insert a NOP 
     code if it saw that the output would otherwise produce an 
     undesired sequence (ref: R. Freed's PCP-WARN.MQG and PCP- 
     FIX.MQG), thus producing files guaranteed to be 
     transmittable while using PC-PURSUIT.  Although the current 
     CRUNCH program does not yet monitor for this, the structure 
     is already set up so this (or any other sequence) could be 
     inhibited at any time, yet all files would remain 
     upward/downward compatible.  Other data compression schemes 
     do not have this flexibility.

Version 1.2 -- June 16, 1986 -- Steven Greenberg
     Existing v1.0 and v1.1 versions of these utilities should be 
     replaced with v1.2.  A few minor bugs have been corrected, 
     including one which could cause a possible file error when 
     crunching numeric data files or object code.  In addition, 
     these versions are up to 20% faster, take source as well as 
     destination drive specs, and are still under 2k each.

     The source has been provided for the first time, due to 
     quite a number of requests (please read the copyright 
     message).  All source code is crunched, by the way.  The 
     programs are standalone assemblies, but two "include" files 
     are used due to the large overlap between programs.  CRUNCH 
     or UNCRunch can be assembled with M-80 by just making sure 
     "INCLUDE1.INC" and "INCLUDE2.INC" are on the same drive/user 
     area.

Version 1.1 -- no information.

Version 1.0 -- no information.
