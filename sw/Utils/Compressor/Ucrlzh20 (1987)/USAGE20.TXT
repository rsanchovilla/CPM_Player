-----------------------CRLZH/UNCRLZH v2.0 Usage----------------------------

Since CRLZH and UNCRLZH are spawned from Steve Greenberg's CRUNCH and 
UNCRunch V2.8, usage is exactly the same with the notable exceptions of the 
file extensions used (LZH uses a 'Y' instead of a 'Z') and file limit of 256 
rather than 512.  So...to avoid duplication, merely substitute CRLZH for 
CRUNCH, UNCRLZH for UNCR and 2.0 for 2.8 in the following duplication of the 
CRUNCH/UNCR usage notes:

CRUNCH and UNCR are basic file compression and decompression 
tools for ZCPR3 and CP/M.  A number options allow these utilities 
to serve as hard disk backup and restoral tools, and make CRUNCH 
a convenient tool for creating of archival libraries.  UNCR 
handles crunched, squeezed, and LZH-encoded files.

Under ZSDOS and ZDDOS file date stamps are embedded in the 
crunched file and then restored to disk when the file is 
uncrunched.  In addition, the source file's date stamp is 
transferred to the crunched file's on-disk date stamp so the 
create and modify dates can be checked without uncrunching it.

CRUNCH USAGE:

     CRUNCH {dir:}afn.aft {dir:} {[text]} {/options}

UNCR USAGE:

     UNCR {dir:}afn.aft {dir:} {/options}

All command line parameters are optional, except the source 
filename, which may be ambiguous.  The output filename is 
generated automatically.

The two DIR specifications, the first for the source file and the 
second for the destination file, may be in DU (drive and user) 
form or, if running under ZCPR3, named directories.  If no drive 
or user is given, the current default directory is assumed.  
Under ZCPR3 all 32 user areas are available, but only the first 
16 users are accessible under vanilla CP/M.

"[text]" is an optional text string (CRUNCH only) that can be 
used to identify the file.  The text string must be enclosed with 
square brackets.  During uncrunching UNCR will print on the 
screen any text string contained in the crunched file.

OPTIONS:  The option list must be preceded by a slash and contain 
no embedded spaces.

     A    Archive mode (CRUNCH only).  The only files crunched 
          (or copied) are those that have been modified since 
          they were last backed up, based on the archive 
          attribute.  After each source file is crunched, its 
          attribute will be changed to archived.  This option 
          allows CRUNCH to be used as an simple archival backup 
          tool.

     C    Confirm mode.  Same as I.

     E    Erase existing files without asking.  Suppresses the 
          prompt "Erase existing file (Y/[N])?" when a file of 
          the same name is found in the destination directory.  
          Instead existing files will be erased and overwritten 
          without notice.

     I    Inspect mode.  Allows choosing the files to be 
          processed interactively.  Each filename is displayed, 
          one at a time, alphabetically, and can be tagged for 
          processing, untagged if tagged previously, or skipped.  
          Processing begins after selection is completed.  This 
          mode works similarly to the SWEEP and NSWP tagging 
          concept.

     O    Overwrite mode.  Same as E.

     Q    Quiet mode.  Suppresses continuous console output 
          during the processing of a file.  Only the input and 
          output filenames and sizes in kilobytes will be 
          displayed.  Normally this mode uses only one screen 
          line for each file, so it allows the display of as many 
          as 24 filename pairs at one time.  This mode is also 
          desirable for printing or other slow terminals because 
          they will slow down file processing.

     S    Include system files.  Allows system (hidden) files to 
          be found and processed.  Normally system files are 
          ignored.

     T    Tag mode.  Same as I.

All command line options can be set as the default mode of 
operation (see "Configuration", below).  The command line option 
will then toggle to the non-default mode.  The current effect of 
the command line options is always correctly reflected by the 
usage screen, which can be accessed by "CRUNCH //" or "UNCR //".

DETAILS:  CRUNCH and UNCR cannot handle more than 512 matching 
files.  When system files are being ignored, such files do not 
count toward this file limit.  In archive (option A) mode, 
however, archived files still count, even though they will not be 
processed, because this mode works internally by "tagging" all 
files which do have their archive attribute set.  That method can 
be useful, however, because if inspect mode (options I or T) is 
also selected, all filenames are presented as if inspect mode had 
been selected alone, except unarchived files will already be 
tagged.  It is then possible to tag any archived files that you 
might want to include, or to untag any pre-tagged unarchived 
files you might want to skip.

Pressing ^C will abort either program immediately.  It may be 
issued anytime the programs are running.  The partial output file 
will be closed and erased, so zero-length files or files in an 
unknown condition will not be left on the disk.  Although 
probably of limited usefulness, ^S will pause the programs and 
any key (except ^C) will resume operation.  Pressing ^C after a 
^S will abort the program, but a partial file will not be erased.

While crunching or uncrunching a file (unless in quiet mode) a 
full running progress report is displayed, including the number 
of input and output records, the compression ratio, the number of 
codes assigned, and the number of codes reassigned.  Although 
some of this information has limited usefulness, it is amusing to 
watch.

OUTPUT FILENAMES:  The CRUNCH destination file will have the same 
name as the crunched file, except that the middle letter of the 
filetype will be changed to "Z".  If the source file's filetype 
already has a "Z" as the middle letter, then the last two letters 
of the filetype will be changed to "ZZ"  If the source file's 
filetype already ends in "ZZ", or if its filetype is blank, then 
"ZZZ" will be used as the filetype of the crunched file.  Files 
with filetypes of "ZZZ" cannot be crunched.  When a file is 
uncrunched by UNCR, its original filename and filetype will be 
restored.

DIRECT COPYING:  If CRUNCH creates a file larger than the 
original, this file will be automatically erased and replaced 
with a direct copy of the original.  If the original is already 
crunched or squeezed, or if the filetype matches a type on the 
filetype exclusion list, such as .LBR or .ARK, no attempt will be 
made to compress it.  Instead, a straight copy operation will be 
substituted.  Thus all specified files will be transferred in the 
most efficient manner, facilitating the use of CRUNCH for the 
creation of LBR's or as a backup utility.  Similarly, UNCR will 
either uncrunch or direct-copy all specified files for full 
restoration.

If the source and destination directories are the same, then 
direct copying is inhibited.  In this case, CRUNCH will ask the 
user whether he wants to keep a crunched file, if it is larger 
than the original.

LZH DECODING AND UNSQUEEZING:  UNCR also uncrunches LZH-encoded 
files and unsqueezes as an added convenience.  The file's format 
will be recognized automatically and the appropriate method will 
be used.

EXCLUSION LIST OVERRIDE:  While it is useful to have CRUNCH skip 
attempts to compress certain filetypes when doing bulk transfers, 
there may be instances where you want to crunch, for instance, a 
LBR file.  (As distributed, excluded filetypes are ARC, ARK, LBR, 
and FOR.)  To make that possible, CRUNCH will ignore the filetype 
exclusion list if a filename is fully specified.  The exclusion 
list will be used, however, whenever one or more wildcard 
characters ("?" or "*") appear in the filename.

SPANNING DISKETTES:  If an output disk fills during a wildcard 
operation, the last (partial) file will be deleted and the user 
will be prompted to change disks.  Operation will then continue, 
starting  with that last file.  If the source and destination 
drives are the same, however, then the prompt to change diskettes 
will not be given, since changing the output diskette will remove 
the input disk from which the program is reading.

UNCR WILDCARD LIMITATIONS:  Normally when UNCR is given a "*.*" 
wildcard specification, it transfers all files from one drive 
and/or user area to another, uncrunching crunched files, 
unsqueezing squeezed files, and copying the rest.  If your intent 
is to only process crunched files, you must issue a file 
specification with a filetype of "?Z?".

When the source and destination directories are the same, 
however, a file specification of "*.*" will be automatically 
converted to "*.?Z?".  A side-effect is that squeezed and LZH- 
encoded files will not be uncompressed unless a specific "*.?Q?" 
or "*.?Y?" file specification is given.

FILE DATE STAMPS:  When running under ZSDOS or ZDDOS, CRUNCH will 
store the date and time stamp of the source file in the header of 
the crunched file.  In addition, it will transfer the source 
file's date stamp to the crunched file's on-disk date stamp.  
Since crunching is used primarily for archival storage and the 
crunched file will not be modified in place, this latter feature 
allows you to check the original date stamp of the file without 
uncrunching it.  The access date of the crunched file will be the 
date it was crunched, until you type it with ZLT or uncrunch it.

When UNCR uncrunches a file, it looks for a date stamp in the 
header and, if it finds one, it restores the file's original 
create and modify dates to the uncrunched file.  This restoral 
works equally well with files crunched by CR23D.  If there is no 
date stamp in the header of the crunched file, UNCR will transfer 
the crunched file's on-disk date stamp to the uncrunched file, so 
at least you will not lose whatever date stamp you have.  As with 
CRUNCH, the access date will be the date the file is uncrunched.  
The original access date is stored in the header by CRUNCH, but 
it will not be restored.

If the source file has no modify date, a non-standard condition, 
the modify date of the output file will be filled in from the 
create date.  A blank create date will be transferred as is.

TELENET AND PC-PURSUIT SUPPORT:  CRUNCH monitors its output for a 
sequence that would put Telenet or PC-Pursuit into command mode 
and abort a file transfer.  If this sequence is detected, CRUNCH 
inserts the CRUNCH null code to prevent disaster.

CONFIGURATION:  All the modes of operation set by command line 
options can be configured as default modes.  In that case the 
corresponding command line option will toggle to the non-default 
mode.  (The current effect of the command line options will 
always be reflected by the usage screen.)  In addition, CRUNCH 
contains a list of filetypes that will be ignored during wildcard 
operations.  Up to 10 filetypes can be entered in the list.  
There are also specific options that are only effective under 
TurboDos or vanilla CP/M.

Configuration for both CRUNCH and UNCR is accomplished using the 
accompanying CRUNCHnn.CFG file and ZCNFG, which is available from 
most Z-Nodes and RCP/M's.  The name of the configuration file 
should not be changed.  More complete instructions are included 
on the configuration help screens.
