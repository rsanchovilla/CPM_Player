         MODIFICATION OF REALTYPE COMMANDS AND DEFAULTS

     RealType can be modified to use different characters for its  
commands.  The default value of some setting may also be changed  
to make RealType ready to go as soon as you start it.  Making  
these changes is not difficult and does not require a knowledge  
of any computer language.  To be safe, even expirenced computer  
hackers should make a copy of the original program and put it  
aside.

     These modifications do require the use of the DDT program  
which was probably supplied with your CP/M (R) diskette.  You do  
not need to refer the manual for DDT.  (It is so poorly written  
that you would probably just get confused anyway.)

     The follow table describe the usage of each location.  Any  
of these locations may be changed to any character.  Generally,  
you should use non-printing characters for the commands to  
prevent entering them by mistake.  Changes will be reflected on  
the screen displayed while using RealType.
