ABUSER.COM (v8.4) allows you to change the user numbers  of files 
without copying them from one user area to another.  This is an 
indispensible utility for those with hard disks.  ABUSER allows 
wild cards in both filenames and the from-user area.  If an 
unambiguous filename is entered, it checks for a duplicate file 
in the to-user area and gives you the option of (erasing it and) 
replacing it with the new file.  This version is reentrant; to 
exit, type a <CR> at the >> prompt.

Format: abuser [d:]fn.ft [from-user] to-user[\]

If no from-user or drive is entered, current is assumed.
\  toggles  console output (default:  on) This feature (added  in 
v8.2) allows you to keep a directory list on screen while  making 
multiple moves.

Examples:  abuser blurk.* 8 = all files blurk.* from current user 
to  user 8 
abuser *.zap 7 9 = all files *.zap from user 7 to user 9  
abuser zlnk.* * 3 = all files zlnk.* in all user areas to user 3 
abuser *.* * 5 = everything on the disk to user 5
