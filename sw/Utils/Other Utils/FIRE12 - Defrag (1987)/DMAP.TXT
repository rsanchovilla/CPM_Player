DMAP.DOC  -   Documentation for DMAP.COM

Description:  This is an "un-ZCPR3'd" version of DU3 with only the 'M' command
              left in.  The problem with DU3 is that it is so large that it
              runs out of memory trying to produce an allocation map of my 20
              Meg ST225.  DMAP will print the disk's map on your terminal.

Use:          Simply type 'DMAP'.  The disk's allocation map will be printed
              on the terminal one page at a time.  You may type Control-C at
              the end of any page to abort the program.

Installation: The program is set up for 24-line terminals.  If your terminal
              has a different number of lines, change the byte at address
              104h (just after the initial jump) to the (hex) number of lines
              for your terminal.
