     A bug was discovered in the original release
     of RESTORE.LBR.

     This library now contains corrected versions of
     RESTOREI and RESTOREZ.  The problem was that
     they did not correctly handle small drives,
     specifically those with DSM < 256.  This value
     is typically found on SSSD floppies (and some
     40 track DS 5-1/4" floppies) and on small to
     medium RAM disks.

     The symptoms of the problem are that, after
     running RESTORE, the files are all still on the
     disk, but they are only ONE allocation group
     long, no matter what the original length was.
     However, the size reported by DIR, XDIR, or CRC
     will match the length of the original file!  In
     addition, if you dump out an allocation map of
     the disk after RESTOREing it, you will find the
     files listed, in the proper order, at the
     beginning of the map, then (usually, but not
     always), some ++Free++ allocation groups, then
     more pieces of the files that are listed at the
     start of the map (if they are more than one
     group long), in the same locations as before
     you RESTOREd the disk.

     All that is fixed now, at least on the disk
     sizes and formats I have available to test.
     Thanks to John Lorimer of Denver for reporting
     the problem, and especially for providing
     mapping info that let me track down the problem
     quickly.  If anyone else has any other
     problems, particularly if your disk format is
     unusual, send bug reports to the BBS's listed
     below, or call direct.

     Happy RESTOREing!
