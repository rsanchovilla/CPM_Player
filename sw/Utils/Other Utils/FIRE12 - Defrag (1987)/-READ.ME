Files included in this LBR file are a combination of the original plus
new files. You may want to read the original files for RESTORE from
which this program, FiRe, was created.	It may give you a bit of back-
ground information.

DMAP should be usable under CP/M 2.x but it is untested under CP/M 3.0.
I doubt if it would cause any harm under CP/M 3.0 but I do not think
that it would work properly, especially if a system has a DRM (max num-
ber of directory entries) of 2048, as is the case with my system, a
Morrow Hard Disk system.

Originally SAP (Sort And Pack directory), was included in the .LBR file
but it was a version for CP/M 1.4 or 2.2.  I have replaced it with the
source and documentation for SAPP v20 which is good for CP/M 2.2 or CP/M
3.0 (if using a Z80 CPU).  SAPP will not work under CP/M 1.4 or for any
non-Z80 CPU's.

Source, documentation, and a preconfigured COM file (not that there is
much to be configured), for FiRe are contained in this LBR.  Be sure to
read the documentation, and, as with any "new" program that "works" on
the disk, be sure to use on a backed-up copy if its a floppy, or backup
the hard disk first if doing it there.

Reminder:  the program can take TIME if using on a HARD DISK.  On my
Morrow CP/M 3.0 hard disk system, it took well over five hours.
