OZ1MEM.COM written by Doug Cox, Sept 1985, in Z80 (assembled with the Public 
Domain Macro compiler Z80MR.COM, which I highly recommend).

This program displays the memory of an Osborne 1 or Vixen computer in an 80 
column by 23 row format, with all normal ASCII characters displayed, and all 
others replaced by dots.  The hexadecimal representation of any character 
under the moveable cursor, along with its location in memory, is shown at 
the top of the screen.

The cursor and screen are moved using a sub-set of WordStar commands:
^K quit
^Q beginning of memory
^E cursor up
^X cursor down
^D cursor right
^S cursor left
^Z scroll screen down
^C next screen
^W scroll screen up
^R previous screen 

The display uses the memory-mapped video capability of the Osborne 1 and 
Vixen, and so will only work on those computers.  Feel free to tamper with 
the source code, OZ1MEM.AZM.
