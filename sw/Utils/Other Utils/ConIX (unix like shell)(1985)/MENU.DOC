
Instructions for Installing the ConIX Pull-Down Menu System:
============================================================

Simply  described,  MENU  is a user-friendly  front-end  to  many 
rather  complex  ConIX functions.   Through the use of  different 
levels  of  menus  and built-in help,  the user  will  be  guided 
through many tedious operations with great ease and  reassurance.  

The  goal  of  the  Pull-Down Menu System  is  to  eliminate  the 
inconvenience  of  constantly  having to  refer  to  the  printed 
documentation  in  order  to perform  every-day  tasks,  such  as 
enabling   the   Print  Spooler, or  setting  a  Disk   Variable.  

Additionally,  the  Menu System interfaces to the  ConIX  PROFILE 
start-up  program  to configure very basic operating  parameters, 
such  as the character sequence used to clear the console  screen 
and   the  directories  used  when  searching  for   a   command.  
Previously,  to  set  these kinds of features,  the user  had  to 
manually  edit his own customized PROFILE and then preprocess  it 
with XCC and install it.  This is now done by MENU automatically.

The  source  code  to  the PROFILE that interacts  with  MENU  is 
provided in the ConIX distribution.  The preprocessed PROFILE.COM 
is  also supplied on disk.   PROFILE itself remains the  same  in 
that  changing  a  default setting does not change  the  physical 
PROFILE.COM file.  Instead, MENU manipulates an intermediate file 
PROFILE.SET which contains the configurations.  This file is read 
by  PROFILE when the system is first started and the commands  in 
it executed automatically.

Installing  the  Menu  System  is merely a  matter  of  correctly 
positioning  the  files in the  disk  directory.   MENU.COM,  the 
program  executed  to change  system  configurations,  should  be 
accessible  from all disk directories.   In other words,  whether 
you  are working on drive A user area 10 or drive B user  area  5 
you should be able to execute this program. The way to do this is 
to  place MENU.COM in a Search Path directory.   For the  moment, 
drive  A:  user  area  0 is good location since the  Search  Path 
defaults to include this directory.  You can change this later as 
you reorganize your disks to your own preference.

More   crucial  is  the  positioning  of  the   PROFILE.COM   and 
PROFILE.SET programs.  In order for these programs to be executed 
automatically,  they  must  be present on the same disk and  user 
area from which ConIX was initially loaded into your system.  For 
example,  if you load ConIX from drive A user area 0, the PROFILE 
files should be stored there.

You will of course note that we have not supplied the PROFILE.SET 
file on your ConIX Distribution.  The reason is that  PROFILE.COM 
will create this file automatically the first time it is executed 
by  ConIX.   Therefore,  after  positioning  PROFILE.COM,  simply 
cold  boot  your  system (hit RESET or turn it off  and  on)  and 
PROFILE  should  sign  on  with  a  message  saying  it   created 
PROFILE.SET.   This  message should never appear again unless the 
settings file was deleted somehow.

Once  all  the  files  are positioned,  you  can  load  MENU  and 
configure your system as desired.   MENU itself does not give you 
particular  steps  to perform for initial  system  configuration.  
You must first read the ConIX documentation to see what you  want 
to  configure  and  then  use MENU to do  it.   MENU  is  not  an 
installation program, but rather a tool to be used at any time.

Invoking  MENU brings us into a little definition of why we  call 
this  a  "Pull-Down"  Menu System.   The reason is  the  way  you 
execute MENU is similar to many modern systems of requesting help 
menus.   ConIX  comes  configured to execute the MENU program  by 
typing a single keystroke - CTRL-B.  Hitting CTRL-B at the system 
prompt  (in the same place you'd hit CTRL-C to reset  the  disks) 
will  cause  MENU to be pulled-down or booted.   Of  course,  you 
could manually enter M+E+N+U+<RETURN>, but hitting CTRL-B is more 
convenient.

The  first  time  you execute MENU,  you will be  asked  for  the 
setting of the Clear Screen Sequence,  which is the ASCII control 
string  used to clear the screen and position the cursor  at  the 
top  left  corner  of your terminal.   Since  every  terminal  is 
different,  MENU  must ask you for your particular configuration.  
You do not have to set it here,  but it is preferable that you do 
since MENU would like to clear the screen at certain points if it 
knew how.

Consult  the operation manuals for your computer/terminal if  you 
don't know the clear screen sequence.   Most terminals use either 
CTRL-L or CTRL-Z to clear the screen.  In either case, to enter a 
control  character,  type  the `^' and then  the  control  letter 
rather than the actual CTRL-x sequence.  

When you finally enter the control sequence,  have MENU set it as 
the  startup default in PROFILE.SET.   This way,  the  next  time 
ConIX is loaded you won't have to reset the CLS sequence.

Once all this initial toil is behind you, you will be given quick 
access  to the main menu screen of MENU.   From this menu you can 
select  various  MENU operations.   All choices should  be  self-
explanatory  after reading the ConIX documentation,  as  MENU  is 
just a supplement to ConIX itself.   However, there are a few new 
additons that MENU was able to bring to your system.

The  first  is  called ConIX Auto-Load.   It's described  in  the 
manual,  but implemented through MENU and PROFILE.  Briefly, this 
feature  when  set  will cause ConIX to  be  loaded  into  memory 
automatically whenever your system is cold booted.   This is done 
by  placing a $$$.SUB submit file in the boot directory  (usually 
drive A user 0, the directory which you are placed into when your 
system  is first booted.)  This SUB file contains an  instruction 
to  load ConIX,  and then ConIX executes the PROFILE which resets 
this file to Auto-Load the next time you boot.   This feature  is 
rather  convenient,  except the BYE command won't work  properly. 
Use the new replacement for BYE, BYEBYE.COM as provided.

Another new MENU feature is that PROFILE can be set to execute or 
chain to another program each time your system is cold booted.  A 
possible  use  for this is to execute a program that  prints  the 
time  and  date  if  your  system  has  a  built-in  clock.   The 
possibilities  are  endless,  and  entirely at  your  discretion.  
Currently,  the  startup  command  feature is  used  to  print  a 
friendly  welcome message,  which you receive whenever PROFILE is 
executed.

If you are not familiar with any other terms/features handled  by 
MENU,  refer to the ConIX documentation.   Be reassured, however, 
that   MENU  will  not  change  any  configurations  unless   you 
explicitly  tell  it to.   So,  you can explore all of  the  menu 
features,  read  the short help messages,  and still not make any 
configuration changes.

In  total,  the  Pull-Down Menu System should prove to be a  very 
useful and convenient tool for painlessly integrating ConIX  into 
your system.
