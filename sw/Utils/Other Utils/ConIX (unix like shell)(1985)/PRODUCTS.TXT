The ConIX Programming System is	an add-on product which
enhances the capabilities of the basic ConIX Operating System.
This package provides several utilities	including an
incredibly powerful, full-featured "shell" programming
language which replaces	the obsolete CP/M SUBMIT facility.

At the heart of	the system is a	special	Preprocessor which
translates program source code into an execution-optimized
pseudocode.  ConIX runs	this file directly off disk using a
virtual-memory scheme.	This innovative	design provides
execution speed	surpassing that	of many	minicomputers!

"A powerful... excellent programming language."

		* ConIX	Questions & Answers *
		* * * *	* * * *	* * * *	* * *

What exactly is	ConIX?

ConIX can be described as a replacement	for the	Console
Command	Processor - the	part of	CP/M that processes and
executes commands.  In addition	to supporting all the existing
CCP functions, ConIX adds hundreds of new commands and
features to CP/M, from internal	commands that are available at
the system prompt level, to System Calls that go deep into the
inner workings of your computer.  That makes ConIX more	than
just a CCP replacement.	 That makes ConIX an Operating System!


I've seen other	programs that have similar features.
How does ConIX compare?

While other manufacturers offer	CP/M enhancements, none	can
even compare to	ConIX as far as	price per feature and
functionality.	If you pieced together a set of	software from
different companies that came as close as possible to what
ConIX provides,	the total cost would be	over $300.  At that
price you'd get	a set of programs that run independently, and
don't even interface with each other.  If you take a good look
at ConIX, you'll find it one of	the best buys in software
available today!


Does ConIX use a lot of	memory and disk	space?

Some programs are overly expensive with	regard to disk and
memory usage, partly because they were written mainly to be
sold, and not to be used.  ConIX, on the other hand, is	most
efficient in these areas.

Advanced Disk Buffering, Disk Optimization, and	Memory
Management techniques make ConIX very thrifty and highly
flexible as far	as disk	and memory overhead is concerned.  In
fact, our archiver can even compact disk file storage by more
than 50%!


Will ConIX slow	my system down?

ConIX was designed to perform acceptably fast on a 2 MHz 8080
with 8"	SSSD drives, the slowest existing CP/M system.	If
your system runs any faster than the crawl of an 8080, you may
not even notice	a difference in	speed.	In fact, if you	use a
hard or	RAM disk, ConIX	will improve system performance!


Will I lose CP/M compatibility with ConIX?

ConIX does not replace CP/M, but actually works	with it.  A
valid analogy is:  CP/M	is to ConIX what the BIOS is to	CP/M,
thus all of CP/M functions as the "system dependent section"
under ConIX.  Since CP/M will never leave your system,
complete software and data file	compatibility can be assured.






Will ConIX really work on my system?

If your	system has an 8080/8085/Z80 CPU	with at	least 48K of
memory,	running	CP/M 2.2, 3.0, or an equivalent	(emulators
included), the answer is yes.  ConIX is	machine	independent
within the CP/M	family,	so you don't have to worry about
things like disk controllers, terminal type and	printer	brand.
ConIX uses the same internal conventions as any	standard
program, and simply requires CP/M compatibility	in order to
run.


How difficult will it be for me	to install ConIX?

ConIX can be installed in as little as one minute without any
modifications to existing hardware or software!	 There are no
complicated installation programs that ask a barrage of	101
questions about	intricate details even an expert couldn't
answer.	 The user is, instead, provided	with the ability to
customize the operation	of ConIX from the system prompt	level.
Everything is truly programmable, and little is	hard-wired at
the time of installation.


What about software upgrades?

We do, from time to time, upgrade ConIX	by adding new features
or improving existing ones.  You will be notified by mail when
these are available.  The price	will always be reasonable, as
we do not believe that our customers should pay	more than once
for a single product.  Our current rates are only $10-$20.


If I have more questions, who do I contact?

If you need more information about ConIX, write	to us at the
address	below or contact your local software dealer.  The
support	you receive as a potential customer will be as prompt
and courteous as given those who already own ConIX.  Thank you
very much for your time	and consideration.
