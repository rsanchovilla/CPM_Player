	ConIX Operating	System				 Memory	Management

	4.  Memory Management

	ConIX is very small considering	the number of features it
	provides.  However, its	approximate 25K	size is	enough to take a
	sizable	chunk out of the memory	available in any micro.	 The
	crunch can be most harshly felt	in the reduced workspace for
	programs, such as text editors,	which need as much memory as they
	can get.  Some programs	make you pay in	memory for their features.
	Not ConIX!

	The test of time proves	any program's usability.  If a program is
	cumbersome to use, it will simply fall into oblivion on	some dusty
	shelf.	To prevent such	a dreary destiny for our program, we have
	devoted	much time to making ConIX be more of a benefit to the
	user, rather than a detriment.	The environment	it provides is
	extremely powerful and useful, while it	has many features and
	settings designed to make sure it will not get in the way of what
	you want to accomplish.	 Memory	Management is one of those
	features.

	Simply defined,	Memory Management is the process by which ConIX
	manages	the amount of TPA memory it occupies in	your system.  The
	time when you usually need as much memory as possible is when
	running	a program, so that more	data can be kept in active
	workspace.  It is at this point	that you can select the	amount of
	memory allocated for use by ConIX.

	There are eight	different levels of Memory Management which can	be
	set by the user, depending upon	how much memory	is needed.  Each
	level corresponds to a segment of the ConIX machine code which is
	actively stored	in memory.  Set	at its highest level (8), ConIX
	will take up as	little as (12K of TPA memory!  Such a small amount
	of memory will definitely go unnoticed when you're running any of
	your CP/M programs.

	The first is the lowest	level of Memory	Management.  When set at
	this segment, no management takes place	and ConIX occupies the
	maximum	amount of memory which it needs	to reside, in its
	entirety, in your system.  Every time you move up one level, all
	previous levels	get thrown out of memory before	the execution of a
	disk-based command.  The space occupied	by the discarded levels	is
	then made available for	use by the running program.

	Once the program finishes execution, ConIX automatically reloads
	only as	much of	itself as is needed to process your commands (to
	level 5).  If you request a built-in command from a segment of
	ConIX which is not currently in	memory,	then only that segment
	will be	loaded.	 All reloading is done from the	original CONIX.COM
	file, which was	used by	CP/M to	bring ConIX into your system
	initially.  The	memory manager will look for this file in the
	default	directory which	was set	when the initial CP/M load took
	place.	This location may be changed with the OPT +CX internal
	command.

	Memory Management			    ConIX Operating System

	The Memory Management level can	be set by using	the OPT	+/-MM
	internal command, as:

		<A:00> opt +mm <#level>

	The specified level number will	be the default each time a disk-
	based program is executed.  For	example, typing:

		<A:00> opt +mm 5

	will set ConIX to invoke Memory	Management and remove code from
	level 1	to 4 each time a command is loaded from	disk.

	Execution of an	internal command can only increase the amount of
	memory being used by ConIX since the command may lie in	a segment
	which had been managed out of memory.  However,	this increase is
	only temporary as these	segments will again be freed when another
	.COM program is	executed.

	The Memory Management level may	also be	modified for a single
	program	by typing:

		<A:00> [m=<#level>]  command  (arg(s))

	This change is only temporary as the default level set by OPT +MM
	will once again	be used	for all	following commands, unless
	respecified.

	Memory Management is a fast and	efficient means	by which you can
	allocate space for program execution.  With this feature, you can
	be sure	that ConIX will	never get in your way!


	4.1  Management	Levels

	The eight levels of Memory Management serve to group the ConIX
	internal machine-code segments by different functions.	These
	segments, and the functions contained within them, are described
	below.

	Level 1: Programming Functions

	  This is the topmost level of ConIX (where the	top is the
	  beginning and	the bottom is the end of the ConIX machine code).
	  It contains data manipulation	commands which are most	often used
	  only within a	Command	Language program.

	Level 2: XCC Commands

	  This is the segment which contains the instructions necessary
	  for the execution of Command Language	programs.  It is,
	  therefore, only used when such a program is running.

	ConIX Operating	System				 Memory	Management


	Level 3: General Utilities

	  The commands within this segment are used more often than those
	  in the first segment,	but not	as often as those in the fourth.
	  It is	an in-between group, mainly intended to	break up the size
	  of the entire	Utilities code section.	 Most of the commands
	  stored here are used for manipulating	memory.

	Level 4: Utilities

	  These	are the	most often used	commands or utilities.	You are
	  most likely to access	this segment more often	during the course
	  of using your	system than any	other level above it.  For
	  example, the DIR and ERA commands reside here.

	Level 5: Command Line Setup

	  This segment is significantly	larger than any	of the previous
	  ones.	 It contains the Command Line Processor, or parser, which
	  performs all the command line	setup such as decoding arguments
	  and variables.  It also contains the loader, which searches
	  internally and on disk for the commands you enter.  After the
	  command is found, the	selected redirection buffers and routines
	  are activated	within this segment.

	  Needless to say, this	section	must be	around in order	to process
	  your commands.  Therefore, if	Memory Management is set to a
	  higher level (above 5), this section and everything which is
	  ``managed out'' below	it, must always	be reloaded after the
	  execution of a disk-based program.

	  To prevent delays after running programs, we recommend that
	  Memory Management be set by default (using the OPT +MM internal
	  command) to this level, namely 5.  If	you must occasionally
	  execute a program that requires more memory, specify a higher
	  level	of management using the	[M] Command Line Option.

	  If you run programs that need	a lot of memory	more often than
	  not, then specify the	default	level to be higher than	5.  When
	  you run a command that does not need that much memory, specify a
	  lower	level of management using [M], to prevent memory from
	  being	freed unnecessarily.

	Level 6: Redirection and SysCall Decoder

	  This is the most important segment of	ConIX because it contains
	  all of the run-time features which programs might utilize during
	  their	execution.  For	example, Redirection, Print Spooling, and
	  Function Keys	are included within this section.

	  When Memory Management is set	to level 6 or lower, you will lose
	  absolutely nothing as	far as features	are concerned.	ConIX will
	  handle itself	properly knowing the memory usage restrictions
	  imposed upon it by the user and no functionality will	be lost

	  because of this.  However, if	this section is	managed	out
	  (management level set	above 6), a program will run exactly as	it
	  would	under regular CP/M, which means	that all the ConIX
	  features would be lost during	execution.  The	features will, of
	  course, return for use by the	built-in commands, but they will
	  be inaccessible to disk-based	software.  Therefore, whenever
	  possible, this level should not be managed out, so as	to prevent
	  such a drastic loss from occurring.

	Level 7: Permanent Data	Storage

	  This is the section where the	ConIX ``internal'' data	values are
	  stored.  All the changes and customizations of features which
	  were made during the course of using ConIX are recorded in this
	  section.  If it is managed out (i.e.,	management level set to
	  8), the data stored in this section (about 4K) must be saved so
	  that the user's changes will remain when ConIX returns.  This	is
	  done by writing the permanent	data area to a disk file,
	  CONIX.DAT, stored in the default directory which was externally
	  set when ConIX was first loaded from CP/M.  If CONIX.DAT already
	  exists and is	set to R/O, it will not	be overwritten and the
	  file CONIX.DA$ will be used instead.	In any case, the temporary
	  file will be created with its	SYS attribute set and deleted once
	  ConIX	is reloaded.  The OPT +CD internal command may be used to
	  change the directory which will hold this file.

	Level 8: System	Loader

	  This is the highest possible level of	Memory Management.  All	of
	  ConIX	is gone	except for a very small	loader which reloads the
	  permanent storage section (level 7) from the temporary file
	  CONIX.DAT/$.	Level 7	also contains the Memory Management code
	  which	is then	used to	reload ConIX to	level 5	so that	additional
	  commands can be processed.



	4.2  ConIX System Memory Map

	When running ConIX, your system's memory will be organized in the
	following way:

	The first block	of memory is page zero which starts at location
	0000h and is reserved for certain system functions, such as:

		0000h	Warm Boot
		0001h	BIOS Address
		0005h	BDOS SysCalls
		0006h	End of TPA + 1
		005Ch	Default	FCB (36	bytes)
		0080h	Default	DMA (128 bytes)

	The next area in system	memory is the TPA, which is active memory
	used to	store and execute disk-based (.COM) programs.  ConIX
	occupies part of the TPA memory, the amount of which depends upon
	the Memory Management level in effect.	This is	also the area
	where the CCP resided before ConIX took	its place.  Following
	ConIX is the loader segment which is a small (12K byte program
	that reloads ConIX when	it is entirely managed out (level was set
	to 8).

	Finally, comes CP/M itself and the BIOS	system-dependent
	functions.  These segments might not always be resident	in this
	area of	memory if your system is running a CP/M	emulator, or
	implements memory bank-switching.  Consult your	system manuals for
	more information about the particulars of your CP/M
	implementation.

	Memory Management			    ConIX Operating System

	4.3  Memory Usage Rules

	It is quite obvious that a disk	can hold much more data	than
	active computer	memory,	as most	disks can store	more than the 64K
	bytes of memory	that an	8-bit processor	can address.  Therefore,
	it would seem logical to use the disk for operations which would
	not fit	into memory.  Most programs operate as such if they must
	handle data which can vary either small	or large, as a program for
	a compiler, or a text file for an editor.

	If such	a program is to	be efficient, it will try to use as much
	memory as possible before going	to disk	for the	remainder of the
	data.  This is the fastest method, as memory is	electronic and not
	mechanical like	a disk,	and should be used instead of disk
	whenever possible.  ConIX internally does exactly that by managing
	how much memory	is actually needed at one time.	 But there is
	actually more that the user can	do with	memory than ConIX can do
	for itself automatically.

	A great	deal of	the flexibility, speed and convenience offered by
	ConIX lies in its attitude towards the way memory is to	be used.
	ConIX contains many functions which allow you to specify the areas
	of memory in which certain operations are to take place.  You are
	given the freedom to use any part of memory that you like.  It is
	entirely left up to the	user to	specify	memory which will not
	interfere with the data	storage	and functions of ConIX itself.

	The user should	be aware that all memory is volatile, and may be
	changed	at any time by a running program, or by	ConIX itself.  The
	operation of ConIX is most definitely predictable, as you can
	always determine its start address with	the TOP	internal command.
	Any memory between location 100h and this address may be utilized
	for memory functions.  This area is called the Transient Program
	Area, or just TPA.

	Many disk programs use only a set, or at least predictable amount
	of memory.  You	can usually figure out how much	memory is
	available for holding some more	permanent data.	 Generally, most
	ConIX internal commands	do not break into the TPA, so if you don't
	run a program off disk,	you can	pretty much be assured that this
	memory will remain untouched.  If an internal command will modify
	the TPA	segment	of memory, then	it will	be clearly mentioned in
	this manual.

	Memory is highly recommended for use with data which is	small
	enough to be stored without any	loss.  If you specify a	segment	of
	memory which is	not large enough to hold the given data, ConIX is
	smart enough not to exceed its bounds and simply excludes the
	remainder.  Although levity in assigning memory	can be quite
	fatal, if used carefully, you can achieve execution speeds which
	rival the larger minis.

	4.4  Notes

	The amount of memory required by a program is usually dependent
	upon its size and the amount of	space required for storing run-
	time data.  If a program is too	large to be loaded into	available
	memory,	ConIX will print an appropriate	error message and abort.
	At this	time, you should keep setting a	higher Memory Management
	level until the	program	can load.

	Once the program is loaded, it may not execute or run properly due
	to a lack of memory.  If this is the case, you should try an even
	higher level.  But remember, once you pass level 6, programs can
	no longer take advantage of ConIX features.  We	have found
	programs like WordStar and dBase II to run fine	at level 6.  (The
	command	line option string we use is [m=6,f,o].)
