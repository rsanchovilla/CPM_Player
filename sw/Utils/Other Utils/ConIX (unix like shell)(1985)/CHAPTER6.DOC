	ConIX Operating	System					 Variables

	6.  Variables

	ConIX provides many different types of variables which can be used
	to programmably	include	text on	the command line.  Wherever a
	variable is referenced on the command line, the	characters it
	contains will be substituted in	place of the reference,	as if they
	had been typed by the user.  The only difference is that special
	characters (double quotes, command separators, and variable
	references) which appear within	a variable will	not be recognized
	as being special by the	Command	Line Processor.	 We will describe
	a method of getting around this	limitation in a	following section.

	Variables are referenced by preceding their name with the dollar-
	sign character,	`$'.  If an invalid variable reference is given,
	the dollar-sign	itself will be included	as an actual character on
	the command line.  If a	variable does not contain any text, no
	characters will	be included on the command line	when it	is
	referenced.  The different types of variables and their	usages
	will be	described in the sections that follow.


	6.1  Disk-Based	Variables

	ConIX provides 52 disk-based variables,	each of	which can be used
	to hold	up to 255 characters.  Because they are	stored on disk (in
	the file A:0/VARS.SET),	their contents will remain even	after a
	reset or a power down.	These variables	are referenced as $a, $b,
	$c, . .	. $z and $A, $B, $C, . . . $Z, for a total of 52
	variables.  The	only difference	between	these two sets is the case
	of the variable	letter.	 Care should be	taken to make sure that
	lowercase variables are	properly referenced so they will not be
	mapped to uppercase on the command line.

	The contents of	the disk variables may be modified by the SET and
	= (Equals) commands, which are described in detail in the commands
	section.  For the purpose of providing examples	of variable usage,
	we will	describe a simple form of the SET command in the
	paragraphs to follow.

	The syntax of the SET command is:

		<A:00> set <variable> =	(value)

	where variable is a single letter describing the disk variable
	(a-z or	A-Z) and value is a single argument which will be assigned
	as the contents	of the specified variable.  For	example, the
	command	line:

		<A:00> set a = "Hello there!"

	will set the variable `$A' (remember that `a' got mapped to an
	`A') to	the string ``Hello there!''.  The double quotes	are
	required in order to get the two words into the	single argument
	required by SET.  These	quotes only serve to create an argument,
	and are	not entered into the variable's	value string.  If you



				       6-1





	Variables				    ConIX Operating System

	would want quotes in the value,	they must be preceded by a
	backslash (as was described earlier).

	To reference a variable	on the command line, for example, as the
	argument to the	program	ECHO, type:

		<A:00> echo $a
		HELLO THERE!
		<A:00>

	which is the same as if	you would have typed:

		<A:00> echo Hello there!
		HELLO THERE!
		<A:00>

	Notice how the contents	of `$A'	were mapped to uppercase, although
	it contains the	upper and lowercase characters that were entered
	by SET.	 This operation	can be defeated	by putting quotes around
	the variable, as:

		<A:00> echo "$A"
		Hello there!
		<A:00>

	The operation of the quotes is the same	with variables as with any
	characters entered directly on the command line.  Notice that the
	variable reference was made as "$A" since we were previously
	relying	upon ConIX to map the `a' character to uppercase.  When	in
	quotes,	"$a" would reference a different variable `$a' since no
	uppercase mapping takes	place.

	It is important	to realize that	the variable substitution occurs
	before the specified command or	program	executes.  This	definition
	is most	essential in understanding why:

		<A:00> set a = "echo $A"

	causes the variable `$A' to contain the	character string
	``echo Hello there!''.	Since the reference is expanded	before the
	SET command executes, we may set a variable to itself plus another
	variable or string.

	If we examine this new `$A' as before, we'd get:

		<A:00> echo "$A"
		echo Hello there!
		<A:00>

	since the variable itself contains the word ``echo''.  As a next
	step in	understanding variables, you can type:







				       6-2





	ConIX Operating	System					 Variables

		<A:00> $a
		HELLO THERE!
		<A:00>

	where the entire contents of the variable acts as the command
	line.  This is exactly as if you would have manually typed:

		<A:00> echo Hello there!
		HELLO THERE!
		<A:00>

	Using variables	in this	way, complex command strings may be
	recalled and executed with only	two keystrokes.	 For example, if
	we set `$A' as:

		<A:00> set a = "exec dir; era foo.asm; ed foo.asm"

	we could run that entire command list as:

		<A:00> $a
		     .
		     .	displays the directory
		     .
		     .	erases "FOO.ASM"
		     .
		     .	invokes	an editor on "FOO.ASM"
		     .
		<A:00>

	The EXEC command was necessary to cause	the interpretation of the
	semicolon character within the variable.  If this command was
	excluded, ConIX	would try to execute a command `DIR;' which does
	not exist.  The	reason is that ConIX does not parse the	contents
	of the variable, and places it onto the	command	line as-is.  The
	EXEC command causes the	command	line to	be reparsed after the
	variable substitution is performed.

	Note that if `$A' had been referenced within double quotes as
	"$A", the entire contents of the variable would	be placed into the
	zero'th	argument, namely the command string.  This would produce
	an error since there is	no such	command	as "exec dir; era foo.asm;
	ed foo.asm".  Furthermore, we enclosed the value argument string
	in quotes above	because	SET only takes the first argument as the
	variable's value.  We also do not want ConIX to	interpret any of
	the separation characters within the string.  If we left out the
	quotes by mistake, as with:

	Variables				    ConIX Operating System

		<A:00> set a = exec dir; era foo.asm; ed foo.asm
		     .
		     .	sets $A	to "EXEC" (DIR is lost)
		     .
		     .	erases "FOO.ASM"
		     .
		     .	invokes	an editor on "FOO.ASM"
		     .
		<A:00>

	we would clearly not get the desired result because ConIX,
	rightfully so, interpreted the semicolons as indicating	the end	of
	a command.


	6.2  Hexadecimal Variables

	The Hexadecimal	Variables are mainly used for passing data from
	internal commands to the command line environment.  There are 16
	such variables,	each of	which can hold a single	byte value from	00
	to FF.	They are referenced as $$0, $$1, $$2, .	. . $$F.  In
	practice, only a few of	these variables	are utilized by	internal
	commands, although they	all may	be set explicitly with the SHX
	command.  The manual description for each command will tell you
	which hex variables, if	any, will be modified by its execution.


	6.3  Memory Variables

	The contents of	the ConIX Memory Variables are stored in system
	memory,	and may	be as large as available memory	permits.  They are
	lightning fast,	and are	used primarily to store	temporary data,	as
	memory itself is temporary by definition.  They	are referenced as:

		$@(&address)

	where address is the optional 16-bit hexadecimal address at which
	the data is located.  This data	is may be stored by many ConIX
	functions, as described	throughout this	manual.	 The data is
	usually	terminated by the value	FF hex,	and the	contents of the
	variable will be substituted onto the command line until that
	point.	For example, the command:

		<A:00> echo $@37f0

	passes to ECHO the string of characters	stored in memory beginning
	at location 37F0 hex until the FF hex terminator byte.

	If no address is given,	$@ references the contents of the default
	memory buffer.	This buffer can	store up to 128	characters, and	is
	located	within the system memory occupied by ConIX.

	6.4  Filename Expansion

	Filename Expansion provides the	user with the convenience of
	referencing a common group of filenames	without	having to type
	them individually on the command line.	The syntax of this feature
	is:

		*:(:)(/)<pattern>

	The sequence `*:' indicates the	start of a filename expansion
	string.	 The names of all files	matching the given pattern for
	FILE.EXT will be placed	onto the command line in place of the
	pattern	which may contain the `?' and `*' characters, as
	conforming with	standard CP/M pattern matching.

	If the optional	`:' is used, the matched filenames will	be
	preceded with the disk code (A:	- P:) corresponding to the disk	on
	which they were	found.	If the optional	`/' is used, the user area
	will be	included.  Both	may be combined	as `:/'	to include both
	disk and user areas.

	To illustrate this feature we will provide some	examples:

	Assuming the disk directory contained four files:  FOO.ASM,
	FOO.COM	BAR.ASM, BAR.COM you could type:

		<A:00> echo *:*.*
		FOO.ASM	FOO.COM	BAR.ASM	BAR.COM
		<A:00>

	where all the files residing in	the current directory are matched
	and their names	substituted onto the command line.  You	may use
	more complex patterns, as:

		<A:00> echo *:foo.*
		FOO.ASM	FOO.COM
		<A:00>

	which only matches files whose names begin with	`FOO.',	or:

		<A:00> echo *:*.asm
		FOO.ASM	BAR.ASM
		<A:00>

	which only matches files with names ending in `.ASM'.  Use:

		<A:00> echo *::/*.asm
		A:00/FOO.ASM A:00/BAR.ASM
		<A:00>

	to include the disk and	user area with the filenames.

	Variables				    ConIX Operating System

	6.5  Programmable Function Keys

	ConIX takes the	concept	of variables a bit further by allowing you
	to reference any of the	52 Disk-Based Variables	while working
	within a running program.  Their contents can be recalled into the
	actual input of	the program, just like conventional function keys
	found on many fancy terminals.

	At any point while running your	program, simply	type a special
	lead-in	control	sequence followed by the single	character
	corresponding to the variable you want to access ($a-z,	$A-Z).
	The contents of	the corresponding variable will	appear on your
	screen as if you would have typed it there manually.  By default,
	the lead-in character is not set, so as	to prevent conflicts with
	special	control	sequences that are being used at a particular
	installation.  We recommend setting the	lead-in	to CTRL-F by using
	the OPT	+/-FK internal command,	as:

		<A:00> opt +fk '^f

	If CTRL-F is undesirable, any control sequence not already defined
	within ConIX can be used.


	6.6  Programmable Character Keys

	ConIX requires many special characters for use with different
	built-in features.  Because not	all computers have these
	characters available on	their keyboard,	ConIX provides a way for
	you to type every possible ASCII character.

	Programmable Character Keys provide a simple and convenient method
	of entering obscure characters,	not only to ConIX, but also to any
	running	program.  You can define up to 24 such keys, each of which
	can produce any	desired	ASCII character.  These	keys may be
	accessed in the	same manner as the regular Programmable	Function
	Keys.  Just type the special lead-in character,	and follow it with
	the single letter which	corresponds to the character you want to
	type.  That character will appear on the screen	just as	if it was
	entered	directly by hitting a dedicated	key on the keyboard.

	By default, the	lead-in	is not set so as to prevent possible
	conflicts.  We recommend using CTRL-K, which may be set	via the
	OPT +/-FC internal command as:

		<A:00> opt +fc '^k

	Some of	the keys have been preset to produce certain characters
	which are usually not found on some older-style	keyboards.  For
	example	`b' is set to produce a	backslash by simply typing <CTRL-
	K>b.  See the OPT internal command in the commands section for a
	listing	of their preset	values and how they may	be redefined or
	modified to include additional characters.

	6.7  Notes

	Since the dollar-sign is hard-coded as the lead-in for all command
	line variable references, certain oddities can be produced by
	unsuspecting users.  For example, the command:

		<A:00> stat file.ext $r/o

	will not execute as expected, but rather as:

		<A:00> STAT FILE.EXT <variable $R>/O

	where the contents of disk-based variable $R will be substituted
	in place of the	reference `$r'.	 Preceding the dollar-sign with	a
	backslash will defeat the automatic interpretation of the `$' as
	indicating the start of	a variable reference.
