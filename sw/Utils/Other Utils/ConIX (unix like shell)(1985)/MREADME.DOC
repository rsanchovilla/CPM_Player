The ConIX Documentation Distribution contains the following files:


.DOC Manual Source Files
------------------------
CHAPTER0.DOC - Front Cover, Attorney Euphoria, Contents
CHAPTER1.DOC - Foreword
CHAPTER2.DOC - Getting Started
CHAPTER3.DOC - The Command Line
CHAPTER4.DOC - Memory Management
CHAPTER5.DOC - Files
CHAPTER6.DOC - Variables
CHAPTER7.DOC - Redirection
CHAPTER8.DOC - Utility Commands


The above manuals contain the primary text of the regular typeset
ConIX Instructional Manual, available from CHI for $9.95 plus
$4.50 p&h.  The text is formatted with an 8-character left margin
so that standard 80-column printout paper can be punched at a
reasonable distance from the printed text.  The files contain no
control characters other than cr, lf, and tab.  

To print these files, use a program which does not paginate, since
the files are already paginated for 66 lines per page.  If no such
program is available, the standard Digital Research PIP command can
be used, as:

	d>PIP LST:=CHAPTERx.DOC[T8]

where d represents the drive that contains the manual files and
PIP.COM program, x represents the particular manual file (0-8) to
be printed, and [T8] tells PIP to expand tabs to spaces using tab-
stops every 8 characters.  The [T8] option may be omitted if your
printer can handle tab characters.  The PIP command must be entered 
once for each of the 9 manual files.  Pattern matching is not
supported by PIP in this instance.
