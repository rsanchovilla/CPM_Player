Dear CP/M(tm)-80 User,

As a public domain enthusiast you are probably aware that there have
been many attempts in the past to improve CP/M by adding to its
capabilities via memory-resident overlays and Command Processor (CCP) 
replacements.  In this document you will be informally introduced to
ConIX(tm), a new and extensive approach to improving the performance, 
functionality, and usability of your CP/M system.  ConIX is the latest 
and greatest upgrade that's actually bringing users back to CP/M!

ConIX (Console Input Executive) is the proud flagship product of 
Computer Helper Industries Inc., a New York based company specializing
in CP/M and UNIX software as well as computer consulting.  ConIX was
first introduced to the marketplace in October of 1983.  Since then it
has been thoroughly debugged, improved, and an entire product line
has been developed around it.  It has also been reviewed favorably by
Computer Language in June 1985, and Micro/Systems Journal in May 1986.

Since 1983 it has developed a respectable following amongst CP/M users
who have paid as much as $165.00 for its powerful UNIX-like features
and vastly improved user interface.  Today, in an unprecedented move,
CHI is releasing the operating system portion of ConIX into the
public domain as Shareware.

Shareware, as you may know, is a vehicle by which financially viable
companies can place software into the public domain and still receive
the payment they deserve for their product.  More importantly, it gives
the consumer the ability to ``test drive'' a full-up version of the
product without fear of losing hard-earned money on software that may
not suit individual needs.

ConIX is compatible with 48K+ CP/M 2.2/3.0 and equivalent systems,
including emulation software.  It runs with and does not replace
CP/M, thus providing 100% compatibility with existing software and
data files.  ConIX uses as little as 1/2K TPA memory, and 0-27K
disk minimum.  Easy one-minute installation requires no system or
time-consuming BIOS modifications.

ConIX Shareware includes all the software in the regular advertised
product, with the exception of some satellite utility software that
is not necessary for the operation of the operating system itself.
The capabilities provided by ConIX include:

	* Path Searching
	* Automatic Overlay Searching by Extension
	* I/O Redirection and Pipes via Memory or Disk
	* Vastly improved and redesigned User Areas
	* End-of-screen output page pause
	* 8 Megabyte capacity Print Spooler
	* 22 New BDOS System Calls
	* User Definable Function Keys
	* Command line memory access and debugging
	* Virtual disk system
	* Type-Ahead Buffering with Echo and Cancel
	* Over 300 Data Variables and Aliases
	* Multiple commands per line
	* Prompt displays user number and drive R/O status
	* Upper/Lower Case and true Argument Handling
	* Filename argument pattern matching
	* User definable I/O devices
	* Over 100 built-in (non-transient) commands
  	* Sophisticated Memory Management System
	* Ability to trade ConIX-specific software with registered
          ConIX Operating System owners

Also included in the Shareware package is our ConIX Pull-Down Menu
System which adds the following capabilities:

	* Set ConIX features on-the-fly without having to refer to
	  system documentation
	* All ConIX default settings can be changed temporarily or
	  saved for recall each time ConIX is loaded
	* Set ConIX to automatically load and execute after cold boot
	* Fully menu-driven, with helpful prompts and built-in plain-
	  English explanations of all menu functions
	* Quick one-keystroke loading and execution from any drive
 	  and/or user area

We have also included our regular printed documentation in machine-
readable form with each chapter stored in a separate file for ease
of manipulation.

As you can see, even though limited in scope as compared to our
regular version, this is indeed no trivial package.  It is not
software developed for the public domain, and as such registered
ConIX owners receive nothing but the best support services.

ConIX Shareware is available on-line on many popular bulletin board 
systems nationwide for your downloading pleasure.  If you wish to
avoid any applicable usage and phone charges, you may find it more
cost-effective to obtain a copy of ConIX Shareware directly from
the manufacturer for merely the cost of the disk format and shipping
according to the following price list:

	5-1/4" SSDD 48 TPI Soft Sector          $  6.00

the ConIX Programming System ($29.95), which replaces the obsolete
SUBMIT system with a full-featured programming language; the ConIX

purpose utilities that take advantage of the new ConIX features and
BDOS Syscalls.  You will be eligible to purchase these products after
becoming a registered ConIX owner.
