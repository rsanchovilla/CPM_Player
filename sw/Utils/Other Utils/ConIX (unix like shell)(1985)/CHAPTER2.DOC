	ConIX Operating	System				   Getting Started

	2.  Getting Started

	It is very important that you immediately make two copies of the
	ConIX distribution files which you have	received with this manual.
	The first copy should be kept as a backup, to be used in the
	future in place	of the original	which should not be touched unless
	absolutely necessary.  The second will be for use as the working
	copy.  It should also contain a	SYSGEN of CP/M on the operating
	system tracks.	This will allow	you to use ConIX on drive A: and
	reboot (reset or CTRL-C) as necessary.

	Next, you should put the working copy of the distribution disk
	into drive A: and then cold boot your system (hit the reset
	button).  Once CP/M is loaded you will be ready	to begin the
	required installation procedure	as outlined below.


	2.1  Installing	ConIX

	Take a look at the directory of	ConIX files, if	you haven't
	already.  You should see two files, among many,	INSTALL.COM and
	CONIXR.COM.  INSTALL is	used to	customize a copy of ConIX to your
	system's memory	map.  CONIXR is	the ConIX Operating System stored
	in a page relocatable form.  It	can be executed	just as	an
	INSTALLed ConIX, except	Memory Management will not be operational.
	This is	an extremely important feature and must	be available when
	you actively use ConIX as a part of your system.

	The INSTALL program simply reads the relocatable ConIX file and
	makes a	new version based upon the amount of memory available in
	your system.  The new ConIX differs from the original in that it
	is pre-relocated and will not have to recalculate its addresses
	for relocation when started up (a somewhat time-consuming
	operation).  Instead, ConIX will be moved by a built-in	loader to
	the area in memory predetermined at the	time of	installation.

	Before you install ConIX, you must be sure that	your system's
	memory map appears exactly as it will when you will be using ConIX
	in the future.	Some systems require patch programs to be loaded
	which permanently relocate themselves to the top of memory to
	perform	some special function.	Some common patches are	RAM-disk
	and format conversion software.	 In such a case, be sure that all
	patches	have been loaded into memory before INSTALL is executed
	(as should also	be the case each time ConIX is initially loaded
	into your system).

	To install ConIX, type:

		A>install

	at which point you will	be asked for the name of the relocatable
	ConIX data file.  You may hit <RETURN>,	and the	default	CONIXR.COM
	on the current disk will be assumed.  You may specify a	drive only
	(as B:)	if the file is not on the current disk.




				       2-1





	Getting	Started				    ConIX Operating System

	You will then be asked to specify the filename of the INSTALLed
	version	of ConIX.  You may hit <RETURN>	for CONIX.COM, which will
	be created on the current drive.  (Note	that you are required to
	use this filename since	ConIX must access it when reloading during
	Memory Management.)  To	create the output file on another drive,
	simply specify the disk	code alone (such as B:).

	Next, you will be asked	for the	relocation address.  This value
	will be	used to	determine the base relocation page, meaning that
	ConIX will reside in memory from this point and	back toward
	location 0000.	You would enter	an address here	if, for	some
	reason,	you'd want a buffer space between CP/M and ConIX for
	storage	of data	or machine code	routines and patches.  This memory
	would be protected since it is unused and not part of the TPA.

	You should hit <RETURN>	for the	default	location, which	is the top
	of memory as stored in memory at 0006h.	 ConIX will then be
	configured to reside directly next to CP/M, or any patches that
	are present in memory.

	INSTALL	will then request the name of the default startup command.
	This command will be executed automatically whenever ConIX is
	initially loaded from CP/M.  By	default, this is set to
	``PROFILE'', which will	be maintained if <RETURN> is, and should
	normally be, hit.

	INSTALL	also provides the user with the	ability	to disable certain
	ConIX functions	that may cause incompatibility problems	with non-
	standard CP/M 2.2 systems.  The	first is BIOS patching,	which
	refers to the internal operation of ConIX to patch the BIOS in-
	memory jump table.  This action	facilitates the	redirection of
	programs that perform I/O directly through the BIOS, effectively
	bypassing CP/M or ConIX, as the	case may be.

	The BIOS patching operation might cause	problems on some non-
	conventional CP/M systems that do not fully support direct BIOS
	access.	 In such cases,	it may be necessary to disable BIOS
	patching by entering ``off'' in	response to the	question asked by
	INSTALL.  If BIOS patching is to remain	enabled, simply	hit
	<RETURN>.

	The second possibly troublesome	feature	is the ExpanDisk Virtual
	Disk System.  If BIOS patching has been	turned off, ExpanDisk will
	automatically be disabled as well, since this feature must patch
	the BIOS in order to work.

	Some systems, however, may allow standard BIOS patching, but not
	the interference in disk I/O system calls.  (Standard patching
	under ConIX only affects the CONIN, CONOUT, CONST, LISTST, and
	LIST jumps.)  On such systems, BIOS patching can be enabled, with
	the exception of ExpanDisk, which can be disabled by typing
	``off''	in response to the appropriate question.

	Another	ConIX operation	which may cause	system incompatibility is
	BDOS Error Vector Patching.  This feature may cause problems if



				       2-2





	ConIX Operating	System				   Getting Started

	the target system does not implement the BDOS error vector, which
	is a series of four addresses after the	first JMP DECODE
	instruction at the top of the BDOS.  These addresses point to the
	four routines that handle BDOS errors (File R/O, Disk R/O, Bad
	Sector,	and Select).

	In order for these vectors to be implemented under ConIX, they
	must be	patched	in the BDOS to point to	the duplicate vectors
	within ConIX.  If this feature is disabled, programs which patch
	the error vector to trap BDOS errors will no longer be able to do
	so (this is not	really a very common practice).

	All other functions of ConIX are implemented using standard CP/M
	conventions, and should	cause no incompatibility problems with
	even the most complex systems.	The prime requirement is that the
	resident operating system must support all CP/M	2.2 standard BDOS
	operations.  If	this is	truly the case,	ConIX should be	compatible
	with such a system.

	If you are performing a	first-time installation	of ConIX, you
	should hit <RETURN> in response	to all the questions so	as to set
	the default parameters.	 INSTALL will then generate the	final
	executable version of ConIX.

	The next step is to test the newly installed version (see the next
	section) to see	if it performs properly.  Should ConIX blatantly
	fail to	execute, you probably have a system which is not truly
	CP/M 2.2 compatible.  If this is the case, you should re-run the
	INSTALL	program	and try	disabling various combinations of ConIX
	features.  Once	the installation procedure has produced	a working
	copy of	ConIX, it will not have	to be repeated,	unless your
	system's memory	map must be changed for	some reason.


	2.2  Loading ConIX from	CP/M

	The syntax for loading ConIX from CP/M is:

		A>conix	(commands)

	If commands are	specified, ConIX will execute these commands
	immediately after printing the signon message.	For example:

		A>conix	dir

		   .
		   .   directory will be listed
		   .
		<A:00>

	where the directory command, DIR, was executed immediately after
	ConIX was loaded.

	Getting	Started				    ConIX Operating System

	If you do not specify any commands for the initial load, ConIX
	will execute the default startup command PROFILE.COM (or whatever
	default	was set	by INSTALL).  This program is provided on the
	distribution disk and, in its current form, simply prints a
	welcome	message	to the screen as:

		A>conix

		The ConIX Operating System Vxx.yyz
		Copyright (C) 1985, Computer Helper Industries Inc.
		All rights reserved worldwide!

		Welcome	to ConIX System/One!
		<A:00>

	Using the ConIX	Command	Language, you could write your own startup
	procedure which	would automatically perform any	needed tasks each
	time ConIX is initially	loaded from CP/M.  This	is discussed
	further	in the ConIX Programming Manual.


	2.3  Notes

	It is believed that most CP/M 3.0+ systems and,	in general,
	systems	which do not use contiguous memory for the operating
	system and system dependent routines (via bank-switching), require
	some form of BIOS patching to be disabled.  Usually disabling
	ExpanDisk is sufficient	but, in	some cases, it may be necessary	to
	disable	all BIOS patching.

	Additionally, systems that do not use standard CP/M 2.2	often do
	not implement the BDOS error vectors.  We have also found that
	most in-memory patches (for ramdisk, format conversion software,
	etc.) neglect to maintain error	vector compatibility.  Error
	vector patching	should probably	be disabled on such computers.
	CP/M 2.2 systems which have been implemented according to the
	guidelines presented within the	Digital	Research documentation
	should not require any customization customization via INSTALL.
