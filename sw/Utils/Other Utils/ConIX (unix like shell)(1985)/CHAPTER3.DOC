	ConIX Operating	System				  The Command Line

	3.  The	Command	Line

	A major	portion	of the ConIX Operating System is devoted to the
	processing of user commands.  These commands are generally entered
	at the system prompt and form the command line.	 The Command Line
	Processor is the part of the operating system that takes the
	command	line, breaks it	up into	different segments, and	analyzes
	it.  The power of ConIX	lies, for the most part, in its	enormous
	flexibility with regard	to manipulating	the command line.  Exactly
	how this is done, and what features are	available to the user, is
	described in the sections that follow.


	3.1  The System	Prompt

	When ConIX is ready to process a command, it displays a	prompt on
	the console screen in the form:

		<d:##>

	where the single letter	d indicates the	currently selected disk
	drive (A-P) and	the two-digit number ##	indicates the currently
	selected user area (00-31).  For example, the prompt displayed
	when using drive A, user area 0	is:

		<A:00>

	and will be used to indicate the system	prompt in examples
	throughout this	manual.

	If the currently selected disk is write	protected by the operating
	system (the drive set to Read Only), the `:' in	the prompt will	be
	changed	to a `!', e.g.:

		<A!00>

	This will most often occur if you swap disks without resetting the
	drive.	CP/M detects the change	and does not allow you write to
	the new	disk.  To return the drive to normal use, simply hit
	CTRL-C at the prompt level.  Under ConIX, diskettes need not
	contain	a CP/M image on	the operating system tracks.

	Note that the prompt change does not take place	immediately after
	you swap disks.	 The R/O setting is activated only after the disk
	directory has been accessed by a program.  For example,	if you ran
	the DIR	(list directory) command after the swap, the next prompt
	would indicate the write-protected status.


	3.2  Changing the Default Directory

	Whenever you cold load CP/M into your system after a reset or
	power-up, you are automatically	placed into the	default	directory
	of drive A, user area 0.  It is	from this directory that all .COM
	programs will be loaded, unless	you specify otherwise.



				       3-1





	The Command Line			    ConIX Operating System

	When ConIX is initially	loaded,	the default directory which was
	set from CP/M will be maintained.  This	default	may be changed at
	any time by specifying a new directory,	as:

		<A:00> (D:)(#/)

	where D	is the disk directory (A-P), and # is the user area (0-
	31).  Either or	both may be supplied, and the default directory
	and prompt will	be changed accordingly.	 All future commands and
	files will then	be loaded from the new directory unless
	respecified.

	In addition, there exists a method of changing the default
	directory only for the execution of a single command.  The syntax
	of this	feature	is:

		<A:00> @(D:)(#/) <command> (arg(s))

	which executes the command as if it were requested from	the
	specified disk and/or user area.  For example,

		<A:00> stat foo.asm

	will execute the Digital Research STAT command on the file FOO.ASM
	stored in the current directory, namely	drive A, user area 0.  If
	you wished to STAT a file in a user area and/or	disk other than
	the current default, you couldn't supply a user	area with the
	filename since CP/M does not support this.  Instead, you must
	manually change	to the desired directory and then execute STAT
	from there.  Or, more conveniently, you	can type:

		<A:00> @B:10/ stat foo.asm

	which will execute the STAT command from the directory of drive
	B:, user area 10 and return you	to the default directory which was
	previously set.	 This is exactly equivalent to typing:

		<A:00> b:10/
		<B:10> stat foo.asm
		       .
		       . STAT runs on the file FOO.ASM in B:10
		       .
		<B:10> a:0/
		<A:00>

	where you had to manually specify the desired directory	changes
	before and after the STAT command was executed.


	3.3  The Warm Boot

	There are two kinds of boots (short for	bootstrap) under the CP/M
	environment: they are the Cold Boot and	the Warm Boot.	Your
	system does a cold boot	the first time CP/M is loaded.	By cold	we
	mean that there	is no software in memory to perform operating



				       3-2





	ConIX Operating	System				  The Command Line

	system functions.  Once	loaded,	a signon message is printed and
	control	is passed to the CP/M CCP.

	The warm boot occurs while the operating system	is resident in
	memory.	 It has	two primary purposes.  The first is to reset the
	disk system, returning all disks to a writable state.  This is
	most often done	at the prompt level by hitting a CTRL-C	after you
	change disks.

	The second function performs a complete	reload of CP/M and the CCP
	from system tracks of the A: disk.  This operation differs from	a
	cold boot, as there still remains some software	in memory to do
	the reload, namely the BIOS, which contains the	system-dependent
	routines.

	A warm boot most often occurs after a large disk-based command
	program	finishes execution.  It	is really only necessary for the
	purpose	of reloading CP/M, since such programs generally overwrite
	the CCP	with their stack and data areas.

	When working under CP/M, you will notice when a	warm boot occurs
	if there is an increased delay after a program finishes	execution,
	and before the prompt is displayed.  Some programs do not cause
	this delay because they	do not require much memory and,	therefore,
	do not have to overwrite the CCP.  Under ConIX,	this warm boot
	delay is often eliminated entirely, as ConIX usually remains in
	memory while programs execute.	A jump to location zero	or SysCall
	#0 never enters	the BIOS, as this function is handled within ConIX
	itself.

	Hitting	a CTRL-C at the	ConIX prompt will cause	a reset	of the
	write-protect setting of all disks without performing a	CP/M or
	ConIX reload, thereby eliminating much of the usual delay.  This
	should be done whenever	you change disks, otherwise you	will not
	be allowed to modify the data stored on	the new	disk.


	3.3.1  Warm Boot Density Change

	Some computers may use the warm	boot operation to allow	you to
	load different densities of disks into the system.  If this is
	true, the media-type cannot be changed since ConIX will	not supply
	the warm boot that is sometimes	used by	the BIOS to reset the
	density	settings and disk parameter configurations.

	The program WARMBT.COM has been	supplied on your distribution
	diskette for the purpose of performing a BIOS Warm Boot	directly
	from ConIX.  To	execute	a warm boot, simply type:

		<A:00> warmbt

	which will cause ConIX to store	its current environment	(option
	settings, etc.)	on disk, and then exit to CP/M via a standard warm
	boot operation.	 A command-submit file will have been created
	which will cause ConIX to be reloaded along with its saved



				       3-3





	The Command Line			    ConIX Operating System

	environment.

	This complex operation is performed exclusively	by a ConIX Command
	Language program, the source code to which has been provided on
	the Distribution Diskette for your examination.

	In addition, WARMBT will accept	command	line arguments in the
	form:

		<A:00> warmbt <command>	. . .

	where the given	command(s) will	be executed after control is
	returned to CP/M, and before ConIX is reloaded.	 This provides a
	mechanism for executing	programs in the	resident operating system
	without	intervention by	ConIX.

	For example, the command line:

		<A:00> warmbt "dir *.com" stat

	will exit to CP/M, list	all files whose	names end with .COM, print
	available disk space, and return to ConIX.

	NOTE: in instances when	we will	mention	a warm boot in this
	manual,	we refer only to the process by	which a	program's
	execution is terminated.  This does not	mean that an actual CP/M
	and BIOS warm boot operation will take place.  No CP/M reload can
	ever take place	when a program exits via a warm	boot under ConIX.
	It is for this reason that diskettes used with ConIX need not
	contain	a CP/M image on	the operating system tracks unless, of
	course,	an exit	to CP/M	will be	necessary.


	3.4  Command Line Editing

	ConIX supports the standard line editing functions available when
	entering commands or other line	input (via BDOS	syscall	10).  The
	editing	process	has been somewhat refined in operation and also
	contains some new additions.  Valid commands are:

	CTRL-B:	Boot Program

	  When this control character is typed at the first character
	  position after the system prompt, a predetermined program will
	  be booted into memory.  By default, the command MENU will be
	  executed, to facilitate the quick loading of a specialized
	  user-friendly	menu program, if available.  The value of the
	  CTRL-B key can be redefined using the	OPT +/-BC internal command
	  to load and execute any program of your choice.

	CTRL-C:	Warm Boot

	  If this control sequence is entered at the first character
	  position of an input line, a warm boot will take place.  If this
	  was done while entering data into a running program, execution



				       3-4





	ConIX Operating	System				  The Command Line

	  will be terminated and control returned to ConIX.  Otherwise,	if
	  typed	at the system prompt level, all	disks will be reset to a
	  writable state.

	CTRL-E:	Next Line

	  This sequence	is used	to advance the cursor to the beginning of
	  the next physical input line.	 You may then continue entering
	  data from that point.	 This function only modifies the screen
	  and does not affect the actual input data.  It is useful for
	  terminals or printers	which do not auto-wrap when the	cursor
	  goes past the	end of a line.

	CTRL-H:	Backspace

	  Use this sequence to backspace on the	input line and delete the
	  character preceding the current cursor position.  The	character
	  to be	removed	will be	overwritten by a space or blank, thus
	  causing it to	be erased from the screen.

	CTRL-I:	Tab

	  The tab character will advance the cursor to the next	screen tab
	  stop,	which is preset	to every eight characters.  Although
	  spaces will be displayed so as to move the cursor, the ASCII tab
	  character (07h) will still remain in the line.

	CTRL-J:	Line Feed
	CTRL-M:	Carriage Return

	  Either of these characters will terminate the	input line,
	  sending it to	ConIX or the running program for processing.

	CTRL-O:	Restore	Line

	  This sequence	will recall the	previously entered input line as
	  stored in the	input line buffer.  Therefore, if the previous
	  line may be re-used with few or no changes, you may recall it
	  without having to retype it.	Characters deleted by CTRL-H or
	  CTRL-X can also be restored by using CTRL-O.

	CTRL-P:	Transcript Mode	ON/OFF

	  Entering this	sequence once will enable Printer Transcript Mode,
	  which	will cause all characters displayed on the console screen
	  to be	simultaneously printed on the printer (LST) device.
	  Entering this	character again	will disable this feature.  In
	  other	words, it has an on/off	toggling action.

	CTRL-R:	Recall Line

	  The current contents of the input line will be reprinted on the
	  screen when this sequence is typed.  It is a form of screen
	  refresh, which will display the input	line as	it has been
	  entered thus far.



				       3-5





	The Command Line			    ConIX Operating System

	CTRL-U:	Cancel Line

	  This function	deletes	all previously typed characters	from the
	  input	line buffer.  The deleted characters will remain on the
	  screen, and the cursor will advance to the next line.

	CTRL-X:	Erase Line

	  When this control sequence is	entered, all input which had been
	  displayed on the screen will be deleted, and the input will,
	  once again, start from the beginning of the line.  The
	  characters displayed on the screen will be overwritten with
	  backspaces and, thus,	physically erased as well.

	CTRL-\:	Non-Interpret

	  Assigning control sequences to editing functions has caused
	  these	characters to be excluded from direct entry as data on the
	  input	line.  If any special editing characters are to	be
	  entered, use the CTRL-\ sequence followed by the desired
	  character.  This character will then be displayed on the screen
	  and stored as	input without being interpreted	by ConIX.  To
	  enter	the non-interpret sequence itself, simply type it twice.

	DEL (7F	hex): Delete Character

	  DEL is used to delete	the last typed character from the input
	  line.	 The affected character	will be	echoed to the screen as	an
	  indication of	its erasure.  This function is best suited for
	  editing on a terminal	or printer that	cannot backspace.


	3.5  Entering Commands

	When the ConIX prompt is displayed, commands may be entered in the
	same way as when CP/M was being	used.  For example:

		<A:00> dir
		     .
		     .	displays the directory
		     .
		<A:00> era foo.asm
		     .
		     .	erases FOO.ASM
		     .
		<A:00> ed foo.asm
		     .
		     .	invokes	an editor on FOO.ASM
		     .
		<A:00>

	As with	CP/M, all characters entered onto the command line in
	lower case are mapped to upper case before execution.  If a
	command	is built into ConIX, it	is run immediately (as are DIR and
	ERA).  A command which is not internal (as ED) is searched for on



				       3-6





	ConIX Operating	System				  The Command Line

	disk with a .COM ending	(as ED.COM).


	3.6  Executing a Program in Memory (!)

	ConIX contains a special command which allows you to execute a
	program	stored in system memory	as if it were loaded from a .COM
	file.  The syntax of this command is:

		<A:00> !(&address) (arg(s))

	where address is the location in memory	at which the program
	resides.  The args list	is a group of filenames	or other data
	which may be supplied to the program on	the command line for its
	execution.  All	data areas and parameters will be set in the same
	manner as when executing commands from disk.  Thus we can think	of
	the ! command as causing the disk loading process to be	bypassed
	entirely.

	If address is not specified, a default location	of 100 hex is
	assumed.  This address is most significant as it is the	beginning
	of the Transient Program Area (TPA) in memory.	Since all .COM
	programs are loaded into memory	starting at this address, they can
	be re-executed directly	from memory without having to be reloaded
	from disk.

	Take, for example, the STAT program, supplied by Digital Research
	with CP/M.  If you wanted to determine the size	of a file, you
	would type:

		<A:00> stat foo.asm

	STAT.COM would be loaded from disk and executed, reporting the
	number of Kbytes occupied by FOO.ASM on	disk.  Let's say you then
	wanted to determine the	size of	another	file.  You could re-run
	STAT in	the same way as	before,	except with a different	filename,
	or, you	could type:

		<A:00> !  foo.com

	which would execute STAT directly from memory with the new
	argument, FOO.COM.  The	reason this is possible	is that	all .COM
	still remain in	memory after execution.	 Therefore, the	! command
	skips the loading process and executes the program already stored
	in memory.

	There are a few	things that you	should be aware	of when	using this
	feature.  Firstly, some	programs modify	their code and/or data
	areas while running in memory and, therefore, may not re-execute
	properly.  Secondly, ConIX has no way of telling whether garbage
	or an actual program resides in	the memory you specify.
	Therefore, be sure that	there really is	a program in memory before
	you instruct ConIX to run it.  The system may hang if invalid
	instructions are executed.  If used properly, this command could
	really save quite a bit	of time.

	The Command Line			    ConIX Operating System

	3.7  Aborting Command Execution

	If you enter a command at the prompt level and then realize that
	you do not want	to run it, you may abort its execution by using
	any of a number	of different methods described below.

	If you specified a disk-based command (.COM) program, you can
	easily cancel the request before execution begins by simply
	entering the CTRL-X sequence.  You can tell if the command has not
	yet begun to execute if	the cursor is still sitting on top of the
	`<' of the `<A:00>' prompt.  In	other words, the Line Feed
	character has not yet been printed.  At	this point, ConIX is in
	the process of loading the program into	memory from the	disk file,
	and the	command	can be aborted before it starts	to execute.
	However, once execution	begins,	it becomes somewhat more difficult
	to cancel.

	It is unfortunate that,	on most	systems, there exists no
	convenient method of interrupting a program once invoked by the
	user.  CP/M sometimes allows you to abort a program if it is
	currently outputting to	the screen.  You may be	able to	stop the
	output with a CTRL-S and then enter a CTRL-C which will	cause a
	warm boot to take place.  However, if a	program	is disk-bound,
	there is no way	it can be stopped other	than by	forcing	a BDOS
	error message by pulling out the disk from the drive (aargh!), or
	performing a cold system reset.

	With ConIX, as in CP/M,	typing CTRL-S will temporarily stop screen
	(CON) output and CTRL-C	can be used to abort execution.	 In
	addition, ConIX	provides a feature called Disk Wait Control which
	allows you to use a CTRL-S to pause execution when a program is
	accessing a disk.  Once	paused,	you may	similarly abort	using
	CTRL-C,	or continue running the	program	by typing any other
	character.  The	only type program which	cannot be stopped is one
	which is performing some in-memory calculation since it	would be
	impossible for ConIX to	intervene.


	3.8  Multiple Commands Per Line

	More than one command may be entered on	a single command line by
	simply separating each command and its arguments (if any) with a
	semicolon, as:

		<A:00> dir; era	foo.asm; ed foo.asm

	which runs the commands	in sequence from left to right,	just as	if
	you would have typed each command on a separate	command	line.  Any
	spaces before or after the semicolon are optional.  This is very
	useful if you have some	time consuming commands	to run in sequence
	and don't really want to wait around for each one to finish before
	starting the next.

	ConIX Operating	System				  The Command Line

	3.9  Command Arguments

	Most commands can be invoked with arguments, which are words
	passed to the program that tells it something about what you want
	done.  A program can either request data from the user while it's
	running, through interactive prompts or	questions, or it could
	take the needed	information from the command line arguments.  The
	latter method is the route most	programs take if all they require
	is, say, a filename, as	is the case with:

		<A:00> ed foo.asm

	where FOO.ASM is ED's command line argument.  This is also the
	case with most of the ConIX internal commands which gather their
	operational data from the command line.

	ConIX and CP/M differentiate between separate arguments	by the
	space or tab you type between them.  For example, COMPARE may be a
	user-supplied program which compares two files,	as:

		<A:00> compare <file1> <file2>

	where the contents of file1 and	file2 are compared to each other.
	The user may issue the command:

		<A:00> compare foo.asm foo.sav

	where FOO.ASM is the first argument, and FOO.SAV is the	second
	argument to the	program	COMPARE.  Any spaces or	tabs between the
	arguments or after the command name will be truncated to a single
	space.

	It is often useful to combine multiple words into one argument
	without	having the spaces between them act as separators to break
	them up.  Take,	for example, the internal command ECHO,	which is a
	utility	that prints its	arguments, as:

		<A:00> echo    Welcome	to  ConIX!
		WELCOME	TO CONIX!
		<A:00>

	Notice how the spaces (or tabs)	were truncated to a single space
	and the	lowercase letters were mapped to uppercase.  In	this
	example, the total number of arguments to the ECHO command is
	three.	If, however, you were to enclose the arguments in double
	quotes,	you'd get:

		<A:00> echo "	Welcome	 to  ConIX!"
		   Welcome  to	ConIX!
		<A:00>

	You can	see that the spaces were included and the characters were
	not mapped to uppercase.  In this instance, there is only one
	argument which contains	the entire string of three words and
	spaces.



				       3-9





	The Command Line			    ConIX Operating System

	In effect, the double quotes tell ConIX	not to change the case of
	letters	or interpret the meaning of any	separation characters
	within them.  So far, you've been introduced to	the space, tab,
	and semicolon as separator characters.	There are others which you
	will come across as you	read on.

	If you place nothing within a double quote string, then	what you
	get is called the Null Argument.  It occupies space on the command
	line as	an argument, however, it consists of only one character, a
	NUL, which is the same as a CTRL-@ or 00 hex.


	3.10  Backslash	(Non-Interpret)	Character

	One of the most	powerful characters, so	to speak, is the
	backslash, `\'.	 It removes any	special	meaning	that the character
	following it may have to ConIX,	and puts it onto the command line
	just like another character.  For example, if you want to place	a
	double quote within a quoted argument string, you can precede it
	with a backslash as:

		<A:00> echo "\"	  Welcome  to  ConIX!\""
		"   Welcome  to	 ConIX!"
		<A:00>

	If you forgot to enter the backslashes,	you'd get five arguments.
	The first a null, the second WELCOME, the third	TO, the	fourth
	CONIX!,	and the	fifth another null argument.

	As you may suspect, the	backslash can also be used in many other
	instances as well.  For	example:

		<A:00> echo    Welcome\	\ to\ \	C\o\nIX!
		WELCOME	 TO  ConIX!
		<A:00>

	The backslashes	before the spaces between the words serve to join
	them together to form one argument.  The backslash tells the
	Command	Line Processor to ignore the special meaning of	the space
	characters, namely, to separate	arguments.  Thus, the spaces are
	treated	as any other character and are included	within the
	argument.  The backslash before	the o and n of ConIX! causes these
	characters to be entered onto the command line in the same case	as
	they were typed.  In this instance, the	mapping	of lowercase
	characters to uppercase	is suppressed.

	You can	even use the backslash itself as a character on	the
	command	line.  Simply backslash	the backslash (meaning,	don't
	interpret the non-interpret character) as:

		<A:00> echo "Here is a Backslash \\ Character"
		Here is	a Backslash \ Character
		<A:00>

	3.11  Forced Case Mapping

	As we have shown in previous examples, characters entered on the
	command	line are normally mapped to uppercase, unless they are
	preceded by a backslash	or enclosed in double quotes.  Forced Case
	Mapping	is a feature which can even cause the mapping of
	characters within double quotes.  It is	implemented by using:

		_L   to	map all	characters to lowercase
		_U   to	map all	characters to uppercase
		_N   do	not map	any characters
		__   to	return to standard case	mapping

	For example, `_L' (underscore followed by the letter ell) is used
	as:

		<A:00> echo _lHello "There"
		hello there
		<A:00>

	where all characters in	lowercase remained untouched, but
	characters in uppercase	were mapped to lowercase.  By definition,
	the `_L' caused	all characters following it to be mapped to
	lowercase, even	those in double	quotes.	 Similarly, using `_U'
	yields the opposite result, as:

		<A:00> echo _uHello "There"
		HELLO THERE
		<A:00>

	where all characters were force-mapped to uppercase.

	If no mapping is desired, use `_N' as:

		<A:00> echo _nHello There
		Hello There
		<A:00>

	where all characters remain in the same	case as	they were typed.
	This is	operationally equivalent to using OPT -UC before the
	command	and OPT	+UC after it (as described later).

	By using `__' (two underscores), the standard case mapping can be
	returned to its	default	setting, as:

		<A:00> echo _uHello "There" __Hello "There"
		HELLO THERE HELLO There
		<A:00>

	The `_U' converted all characters until	the `__' to uppercase, and
	after the `__',	regular	case mapping was invoked, returning the
	case privileges	of the double quotes.

	The Command Line			    ConIX Operating System

	3.12  Control Characters

	ConIX will not allow you to use	the CTRL key to	enter actual
	control	characters onto	the command line.  These characters are
	generally non-printable, and are sometimes used	to modify certain
	terminal characteristics.  In most instances they can be
	considered undesirable glitch, and may actually	interfere with
	program	operation.  It is for this reason that they are	normally
	stripped from the command line.

	Control	characters span	the range of NUL (00 hex) to US	(1F hex).
	One such character is a	CTRL-L,	which clears the screen	on most
	terminals.  This sequence is entered by	holding	down the <CTRL>
	key with one finger while pressing the `L' key with another.  If
	you entered this sequence on the command line, you'd see:

		<A:00> ^L

	ConIX types the	`^' before the `L' to represent	the entry of the
	CTRL-L character sequence.  If you entered a CTRL-L as an argument
	to ECHO, you'd get:

		<A:00> echo ^L

		<A:00>

	which will not clear the screen, but print just	a blank	line.
	Why?  Because ConIX strips off all control characters from the
	command	line.  It is as	if you hadn't typed the	control	character
	at all.	 But we	shall not ban them totally, for	there are
	instances when you would want them to be there.

	There are a few	methods	that can be used to include control
	characters on the command line.	 You could enter the control
	sequence in double quotes, as:

		<A:00> echo "^L"

	because	the quotes allow control characters within them.  Or, you
	could prefix the control sequence with a backslash:

		<A:00> echo \^L

	because	backslash removes any special meaning given by ConIX to
	the character following	it.

	There is also a	special	character, the circumflex or up-arrow,
	which can be used to represent a control sequence, without
	actually using the CTRL	key.  This two-character sequence appears
	on the screen to be almost identical to	entering the actual
	control	character.  Instead, you spell it out manually as:

		<A:00> echo ^l





				       3-12





	ConIX Operating	System				  The Command Line

	where you type a `^' followed by an `l'	(ell), as opposed to the
	two-stroke CTRL-L code.	 This sequence will be changed into the
	single control character code it represents.  It is especially
	useful in command files	where, if the actual character would
	appear inside it, the screen would clear when you TYPE or list the
	file.  Also, some editors don't	allow entry of control characters.

	Another	special	character is available which will change the
	normal operation of ConIX to remove all	control	characters from
	the command line.  This	is done	with the tilde or squiggle
	character, where:

		<A:00> ~echo ^L
		 . . . screen clears
		<A:00>

	which allows a control character sequence to be	included anywhere
	on the command line.  Using a second tilde would reset ConIX to
	strip off control chars	for the	remainder of the line or until
	another	tilde.	In other words,	the tilde has a	toggling on/off
	action.	 For example:

		<A:00> echo ~^L~ ^A^B^C~ ^G
		 . . . screen clears and terminal beeps
		<A:00>

	causes only the	first CTRL-L and last CTRL-G to	be accepted.  The
	first tilde turns control characters on, the second off, and the
	third back on again.  Note that	using the tilde	will not affect
	the other methods of enabling entry of control characters (i.e.
	"", \, ^).


	3.13  Data Type	Conversions

	Many built-in functions	require	data to	be entered in the form of
	hexadecimal or decimal numbers.	 For convenience, you may specify
	such a number in either	hex or decimal format as:

		&<hexnum>

	where hexnum is	a hexadecimal number from 0-FFFF hex, or,

		#<decnum>

	where decnum is	a decimal number from 0-65535.	In addition, you
	may specify a number as	its ASCII character equivalent,	as:

		'<char>

	which will cause the specified char to be converted into its
	numeric	value and then passed to the command.

	Wherever commands are listed as	requiring numeric arguments, we
	will use certain conventions for describing the	default	data type



				       3-13





	The Command Line			    ConIX Operating System

	that command or	function is expecting.	If an `&' is indicated,
	the default data type is hexadecimal.  If a `#'	is indicated, the
	default	data type is decimal.  In each case, the number	may be
	entered	in the default type without specifying its corresponding
	type character.	 Only when a non-default number	is entered must	it
	be preceded by its special type	character.

	To illustrate, take for	example	the EXAM command which examines
	memory.	 It is defined as:

		EXAM <&start> <&end>

	where start and	end are, by default, two hexadecimal numbers
	describing the start and end addresses.	 If you	wished to examine
	memory between 00 and FF hex, you'd type:

		<A:00> exam 0 ff

	or, if you speak only decimal, you can type:

		<A:00> exam #0 #255

	which would produce operationally equivalent results.  ConIX
	internally performs these conversions automatically.

	Similarly, the SUM command will	add two	numbers, as:

		SUM <#num1> <#num2>

	where num1 and num2 are, by default, two decimal numbers.  If you
	wished to add 10 and 15, you'd type:

		<A:00> sum 10 15

	or, if you wanted to sum two hex numbers, just type:

		<A:00> sum &a &f

	You can	also mix hex and decimal numbers as:

		<A:00> sum &a 15

	Additionally, you can use an ASCII character as:

		<A:00> sum '^j 15

	Each of	these examples would produce the decimal result	of 25.
	Note that the data types given in the arguments	do not affect the
	data type of the result.  SUM will always print	a decimal result,
	regardless of whether it was given hex or decimal numbers as
	arguments.  You	can convert results to decimal or hex by capturing
	the command's output using redirection and then	passing	the data
	to the BDEC or DECB internal commands.	This process will be
	described clearly in later sections.
