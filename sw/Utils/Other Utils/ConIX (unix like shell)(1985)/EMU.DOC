-----------------------------------------------

The   version  of  the ConIX Operating  System  provided  on  the 
distribution  diskette was  designed to function optimally  under 
the  CP/M  version  2.2 operating  system.  If you are installing 
ConIX  under  a  CP/M  emulator  (i.e.   a  non-Digital  Research 
Operating  System),  there  are a few general  steps  you  should 
follow.

INSTALL.COM  - This  program will install ConIX on  your  system.  
Emulator users will probably have to disable at least BDOS  error 
vector patching in order to get ConIX to work at all.   You  will 
probably also  have  to  disable the ExpanDisk feature  or   BIOS 
patching  entirely.  What  must be disabled varies from system to  
system depending upon the extent that the emulator you are  using 
actually   resembles  CP/M  2.2.   There  is,   unfortunately  no 
scientific  way  of  knowing what can be left  enabled  and  what 
should be disabled.  Only trial and error will tell for sure.

EMUFIX.XCC/COM   - Some  implementations  of CP/M  2.2  emulators 
might cause trouble as far as BDOS error messages and warm  boots 
(^C)  are  concerned.   The  symptom  is flakey  operation  or  a 
downright  system crash after a CP/M BDOS disk error  message  is 
printed  or after the user or an application program warm  boots.  
If  this  happens,  you'll have to run EMUFIX each time ConIX  is 
cold loaded into your system.

The  best  way  to  do this is to use MENU to set  a  program  to 
execute  automatically when PROFILE finishes setting  the  system 
configurations.  The command [J] EMUFIX should do fine.   If  you 
are already executing another Command Language  program,  execute 
EMUFIX from within it.
