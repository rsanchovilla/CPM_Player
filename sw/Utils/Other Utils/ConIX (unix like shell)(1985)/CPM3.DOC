-------------------------------------------------

The  ConIX Operating System provided on the distribution diskette 
was  designed to function optimally under the  CP/M  version  2.2 
operating  system.   If you are installing ConIX under CP/M  Plus 
version 3.0, there are a few general steps you should follow.

INSTALL.COM  - This  program will install ConIX on  your  system.  
CP/M  3  users will probably have to disable at least BDOS  error 
vector  patching in order to get ConIX to work at all.   You  may 
also  have  to  disable the ExpanDisk feature  or  BIOS  patching 
entirely.   What  must be disabled varies from system to  system.  
There  is  no  real scientific way of knowing what  can  be  left 
enabled  and what should be disabled.   Only trial and error will 
tell for sure.

CPM3CCPR.COM - This program generates a replacement CCP.COM which 
you can install into your system.  This file is not ConIX itself, 
but simply a loader which will insure that ConIX is automatically 
loaded each time you cold boot your system.  We felt it necessary 
to  provide this program since the prescribed  auto-boot  patches 
often will not work under CP/M 3.

When   you  run  CPM3CCPR,   a  new  file  CPM3CCP.COM  will   be 
automatically generated.   This new file is pre-relocated to load 
at the top of TPA memory.    Therefore,  before running CPM3CCPR, 
make  sure that system memory is organized as it will appear when 
ConIX  itself  is  running  (namely,   all  TPA  region   patches 
installed, if any).

To  install  the new CCP,  copy your current CCP  to  OLDCCP.COM, 
erase CCP.COM, and then copy CPM3CCP.COM to CCP.COM.  Reboot your 
system to have the new CCP load.

CPM3CCP  has  a  few nice features.   Firstly,  when  CPM3CCP  is 
invoked,  it will look for the presence of a file A:NOBOOTCX.SYS.  
If  found,  OLDCCP.COM  will be loaded and  executed  instead  of 
CONIX.COM.  If ConIX is to be loaded, a message will be displayed 
while it is being read off disk.   You may abort to OLDCCP.COM by 
simply hitting CTRL-X.   Remember,  if you BYE out of ConIX,  you 
will  get CPM3CCP.COM which will then throw you right back  where 
you came from.  If you need the CP/M 3 CCP, be ready on the CTRL-
X key after running BYE.

CPM3FIX.XCC/COM  - Some  implementations  of CP/M 3  might  cause 
trouble as far as BDOS error messages are concerned.  The symptom 
is  flakey operation or a downright crash after a CP/M BDOS  disk 
error message is printed.   If this happens,  you'll have to  run 
CPM3FIX each time ConIX is cold loaded into your system.

The  best  way  to  do this is to use MENU to set  a  program  to 
execute  automatically when PROFILE finishes setting  the  system 
configurations.   The command [J] CPM3FIX should do fine.  If you 
are already executing another Command Language  program,  execute 
CPM3FIX from within it.

CP/M 3 RSX FEATURE - Since ConIX was written for CP/M 2.2,  there 
is currently no support for Resident System Extension invocations 
from  under ConIX.   Any RSX's which are to stay  permanently  in 
memory should be loaded before ConIX is cold started.
ll then throw you right back  where 
you came from.  If you need the CP/M 3 CCP,
