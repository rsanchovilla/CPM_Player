	ConIX Operating	System					     Files

	5.  Files

	In this	section	we will	describe how programs and files	are
	treated	differently under the control of the ConIX system as
	opposed	to CP/M.  ConIX	presents some major improvements over the
	standard methods of handling files in order to facilitate their
	storage	in a more logical and space-efficient manner.


	5.1  User Areas

	It can be rather time consuming	to sift	through	a large	directory
	listing	to find	a particular file, especially when their contents
	span many different areas.  For	example, you always have your
	``standard set'' of .COM files along with whatever it is they work
	on.  You may also have a favorite set of utilities (like PIP,
	STAT, etc.) as well as a set of	files related to the others, and
	some totally unrelated.	 You could get pretty sore eyes	trying to
	find a file in the listing of such a large directory.

	One of the more	significant innovations	Digital	Research recently
	added to CP/M is called	the User Area, which is	an attempt to
	solve this storage problem.  Disk files	could be stored	in
	separate directories within a physical disk, thereby eliminating
	much of	the clutter.  You could	think of each user area	as being a
	totally	separate disk with its own private directory.  CP/M
	provides 32 such user areas which are numbered from 0 to 31.  The
	CCP, however, only allows the user to access the first 16 (0 to
	15), where you are automatically placed	in user	area 0 each time
	you cold boot CP/M into	the system.

	One of the biggest setbacks with this implementation is	that files
	which are stored in one	user area cannot be referenced,	on the
	command	line, from another.  In	order for this concept to work at
	all, you would have to make copies of the .COM files you would
	need in	each user area so as to	be able	to run them.  This can be
	extremely storage inefficient, especially for programs such as
	WordStar which require approximately 60K of storage.  It is for
	this reason that most people end up not	using this feature at all
	with regular CP/M.

	ConIX, on the other hand, removes much of the inconveniences and
	drawbacks which	were normally involved in working with user areas.
	On the whole, ConIX creates an excellent environment for managing
	your entire disk system.


	5.2  Standard CP/M Filenames

	A filename is a	means by which the user	can reference a	particular
	set of data stored on disk.  The syntax	of the standard	CP/M
	filename is:

		(D:)<FILENAME>(.EXT)




				       5-1





	Files					    ConIX Operating System

	where D	is a single letter corresponding to the	disk (A-P) on
	which the file is stored, FILENAME is the name of the file (as ED,
	STAT, or PIP - maximum 8 characters), and EXT is an optional
	extension which	is usually used	as an indication of the	type of
	data stored within the file (as	COM, ASM, or BAS - maximum 3
	characters).  If the disk code is omitted, then	the default or
	current	directory (as indicated	in the command line prompt) will
	be assumed.


	5.3  Standard ConIX Filenames

	The standard ConIX filename is similar in most respects	to that	of
	CP/M.  It's format is:

		(D:)(#/)<FILENAME>(.EXT)

	where #	is the user area (0-31)	on which the file is stored.  If
	the user code is omitted, then the default or current user area
	(as indicated in the system prompt) will be assumed.

	Programs written for CP/M will only understand the syntax of the
	CP/M filename.	Using the ConIX	format will yield erroneous
	results.  The reason why is simple:  CP/M did not provide any
	means of associating a user area number	with a filename.  That's
	because	older versions of CP/M did not have user area capability,
	and incompatibility would have resulted	from changing the internal
	mechanisms for accessing files.	 Although we were able to kludge
	our way	around this limitation in many instances, in general,
	specifying user	areas with filenames is	not always possible.

	The majority of	programs written for ConIX, in this and	future
	packages, will accept the new form of the filename.  It	is a very
	useful means for accessing files on disks and user areas other
	than the one you're currently using.


	5.4  Automatic Searching

	In an attempt to improve upon the way the CCP manipulates user
	areas, we have added an	innovative feature to ConIX called
	Automatic Searching.  This allows commands or files to be loaded
	automatically from a drive or user area	other than the one being
	used.  In this way, files or commands which are	accessed quite
	often may be kept in areas common to all disks and user	areas,
	thereby	eliminating the	need for multiple copies.


	5.4.1  The Search Path

	ConIX implements a concept called Path Searching which allows you
	to declare the files within certain directories	as being common
	with all other directories.  This is done by using the OPT +/-SP
	command	as described in	detail in the commands section.	 For the
	purpose	of instruction,	we will	explain	its use	briefly	here.



				       5-2





	ConIX Operating	System					     Files

	The syntax of the command to set the Search Path is:

		<A:00> opt +/-sp <path>

	where path is a	list of	disk and user areas which are to be
	considered common to all other directories.  For example:

		<A:00> opt +sp a0a15

	will set drive A user 0	and 15 to be common directories.  Up to	16
	such drive and user area combinations may be entered into the path
	list.  Whenever	a search feature is invoked (we'll outline them
	soon), the directories specified in the	Search Path will be
	automatically searched for the requested file in the order in
	which they were	specified.

	Note that ConIX	will only search those path disks which	are on-
	line or	logged-in.  Therefore, you may have more than one drive	in
	the path, although it might not	necessarily be in use at any one
	given time.


	5.4.2  Automatic Command Searching

	In standard CP/M, if you are using drive A user	0, and issue a
	command, such as ED, then the file ED.COM is searched for on the
	same drive and user area (the default directory) and loaded if
	found.	Otherwise, an error message is printed,	as:

		A>ed foo.asm
		ed?
		A>

	The same holds true if you were	on drive A-P and user area 0-15.
	Only the current user area directory is	searched.  But remember,
	that was regular CP/M.	ConIX, on the other hand, is much more
	flexible.

	Automatic Command Searching allows you to store	commands in any
	Search Path directory to make them commonly available to all other
	disks and user areas.  Therefore, if you typed:

		<A:02> ed foo.asm

	ConIX will search A:2/ for ED.COM and, if not found there, it will
	search the directories that were specified in the Search Path.

	If you know on what drive and user area	a command lies,	you can
	specify	it on the command line and ConIX will look only	there.	If
	the file is not	found there, no	searching will take place and an
	error message will be printed.	For example, if	you were using
	A:10/ and you wanted to	load a command on A:15/, you can type:

		<A:10> a:15/cmd	 (arg(s))




				       5-3





	Files					    ConIX Operating System

	ConIX will go directly to the specified	directory without
	performing any searching.


	5.4.3  Automatic File Searching

	In the previous	section, we discussed the operation of Automatic
	Command	Searching whereby ConIX	will search all	Search Path
	directories for	the requested command until it is found.
	Automatic File Searching works in exactly the same way,	except we
	are dealing with ordinary files	and not	commands.  The syntax for
	accessing files	in this	manner is:

		:FILENAME.EXT

	which is the same as the regular CP/M format, with the exception
	that the single	letter drive code is omitted.

	NOTE:  It is highly recommended	that searching only be used when
	performing a read operation on the file.  Using	such a syntax when
	writing	to the file may	cause different	results, depending upon
	whether	or not the file	is found and where.  If	you intended on
	writing	to a file in a certain directory and it	was not	there,
	then you could end up writing to another file with the same name
	in a different place, thereby destroying the data within it.  It
	is for this reason that	ConIX does not permit this syntax to be
	used with Output File Redirection (to be described later).


	5.4.3.1	 Searching on the Command Line

	The most common	usage of Automatic File	Searching occurs on the
	command	line when filename arguments are specified.  For example,
	assuming the Search Path to be A0A15, you can type:

		<A:10> type :foo.asm

	ConIX will search the directories A:10/, A:0/, and A:15/ for the
	file FOO.ASM and, if found, its	contents will be printed on the
	console	screen.

	Note that this syntax works with all commands built into ConIX,
	but will not work with standard	CP/M compatible	programs.  There
	exists another method for utilizing ConIX File Searching with such
	software.


	5.4.3.2	 Using File Searching With CP/M	Software

	Using a	special	command	line option, you can reference a file
	within the Search Path when using existing CP/M	software.  The
	syntax for this	feature	is:

		<A:00> [f(=#type)] <command> (arg(s))




				       5-4





	ConIX Operating	System					     Files

	where type is an optional number that determines whether a path-
	login will take	place when ConIX is searching for a file.  If type
	is 0, ConIX will search	only on	those disks which have been
	logged-in, as per standard path	searching procedure.  If type is 1
	or omitted, ConIX will search through all disks	present	within the
	search path, whether they are logged-in	or not,	until either the
	file is	found, or the end of the path is reached.

	When path-login	is used, be sure each drive in the path	is on-line
	(powered-up with a disk	loaded), otherwise the system may print	an
	error message or just hang (depending upon how your BIOS handles a
	drive-not-ready	situation).

	Let's say you were using a BASIC interpreter which was invoked
	from A:0/ and wanted to	load a file from a different user area.
	Under standard CP/M this would be impossible.  ConIX, however,
	allows you to utilize Path Searching to	access this file.  To
	enable this feature for	BASIC, as in our example, type:

		<A:00> [f=0] basic

	Within BASIC you can now type:

		Ok
		load ":test1"
		Ok

	The colon will act as a	signal to ConIX	that the specified file	is
	to be loaded from the Search Path if not found in the current
	directory.  Internally,	the colon will be stripped from	the
	filename and ConIX will	record the corresponding user area for
	future disk references to this file.  Since the	colon occupied one
	space within the 8-character filename segment, you are limited to
	using 7-character filenames (excluding the extension) when taking
	advantage of this feature.


	5.4.3.3	 Automatic Extension (Overlay) Searching

	There exits a few problems with	setting	up user	areas as we have
	described them thus far.  Firstly, you can't specify a ConIX-type
	filename with standard CP/M software.  This is annoying, but it
	can be circumvented in many cases.  The	easiest	way, if	you have
	the source code	to the software, is to modify the program to use
	some of	the added ConIX	SysCalls (described in the Programming
	Manual)	when accessing files.  Unfortunately, that is the only way
	to do it.  If you can't	modify the program, you'll probably have
	to live	with the limitation.

	Secondly, programs which use overlays tend to bomb when	the
	program	is invoked from	any user area other than the one you're
	currently working in.  That may	not be so bad, especially if you
	plan to	use the	software from only that	user area.  In such a
	case, just store the overlay files there.




				       5-5





	Files					    ConIX Operating System

	However, editing programs (such	as WordStar) tend to be	used from
	any directory.	Duplicating the	overlays in each user area brings
	back the problems which	we had with user areas in the first place.

	To effectively get around this,	we have	implemented Automatic
	Extension Searching which would	allow overlays to be stored in any
	one user area and accessed from	within all system directories.	In
	order to use this feature, you must first specify a list of
	filename extensions (.EXT's) for which auto-searching is to take
	place.	This is	done with the OPT +/-XS	internal command but,
	briefly, the syntax is:

		<A:00> opt +/-xs <.EXT>	. . .

	where EXT represents the extension(s) for which	searching will
	take place.  For example, the command line:

		<A:00> opt +xs .ovr .ovl

	will set Extension Searching for files which have .OVR and .OVL
	extensions.  The extension list	contains no entries on start-up.

	Once a valid list of extensions	has been set, Extension	Searching
	can be enabled by using	the [F]	command	line option, as:

		<A:00> [f(=#type)] <command> (arg(s))

	If the specified command should	access any files with extensions
	matching those in the Extension	List, ConIX will search	for the
	file in	the current directory and, if not found	there, along the
	Search Path as well.

	For example, let's say WordStar	and its	overlay	files are stored
	on A:15/ and the Search	Path is	set to A0A15.  If you were to
	issue the command:

		<A:10> [f] ws

	the file WS.COM	and the	.OVR overlays will be loaded from the Path
	directory A:15/.  You can specify [F=0]	if ConIX should	search
	only on	those path disks which are currently activated or logged
	in.  Otherwise,	all disks in the path will be searched,	regardless
	of their current state.

	The way	Extension Searching works internally is	that ConIX checks
	the FCB's passed to the	disk I/O file-open SysCalls to see if the
	file extension within it matches one in	the user-specified
	Extension List.	 If so,	Automatic Searching is invoked and, if the
	file is	not found, an error code is returned.  If found, an entry
	is made	into an	internal table which contains the address of the
	FCB as well as the associated user area.  Future I/O SysCalls will
	check this table for the given FCB address and,	if found, will set
	the user area accordingly.





				       5-6





	ConIX Operating	System					     Files

	Note that Command Searching using .COM extensions is independent
	of this	feature.  Extension Searching for .COM files which are
	referenced within programs (such as dBase II) must be explicitly
	specified within the Extension List.


	5.5  Drive Management

	How many disk drives do	you have on your system?  One, or two,
	maybe more?  Well, CP/M	has the	capability of referencing up to	16
	different disk drives, coded A:	to P:.	It is most unlikely that
	any computer will use all sixteen.   If	that is	true for your
	system,	then you can make this unused capacity work for	you.

	The ExpanDisk feature can make your computer seem like it has 16
	different drives, even if it really has	only one or two.  This is
	done by	redefining the disk code, D:, corresponding to one of your
	drives,	in effect, mounting the	new disk on that drive.	 The
	ExpanDisk drives and the actual	drive to be used for the mount
	disk are set by	using the OPT +/-XD command.  By default, they are
	set to I:, J:, and K:, with the	mount disk being drive A:.

	To utilize an ExpanDisk	drive, simply reference	it as any other
	drive on your system.  For example, you	can change the default
	directory to one of ExpanDisk drives as:

		<A:00> i:
		A: disk	in A: drive - load I: disk
		<I:00>

	This message indicates that the	drive A: disk is currently loaded
	in the A: drive	(the mount disk).  Remove that disk and	load the
	disk which will	now be referred	to as drive I:.	 The system will
	be waiting for you to type a character.	 If you	hit a <RETURN>,
	the disk will be selected.

	Hitting	CTRL-A at the ExpanDisk	prompt will cause the disk system
	to be reset entirely.  A CTRL-B	will reset only	the requested
	drive.	Hitting	CTRL-C will abort the request via a warm boot
	causing	no ``mount'' action.  This is useful for aborting an
	unintentional ExpanDisk	drive reference.

	Once the new drive is mounted, it can be used just as any other.
	The only difference is that its	name was changed to I:.	 You may
	return to disk A:, as:

		<I:00> a:
		I: disk	in A: drive - load A: disk
		<A:00>

	The only ill effect this feature has, is that all previous disks
	mounted	on drive A:, the mount drive, will be changed to the R/O
	state when a new ExpanDisk drive is logged in.	Only this last
	logged drive will remain R/W.  This is because the ExpanDisk
	drives share the same memory used to store the directory



				       5-7





	Files					    ConIX Operating System

	information of the mount disk.	Whenever another disk is placed	in
	that drive, it is set to R/O just as if	you had	changed	disks in a
	regular	drive.

	Therefore, in our example here,	drive A: would be R/O if you had
	swapped	a different disk into I:.  To get the prompt to	reflect
	this, run the DIR command.  Your prompt	will now be:

		<A!00>

	If we return to	drive I: and execute DIR, the prompt will still
	indicate that the drive	is not write protected.	 This is because
	the last update	to the directory information vector was	done by
	this drive, when it was	first logged in.  You can notice this
	``login'' the first time you accessed I:, when the disk	clicked
	before you got the new prompt.	The second time	it did not click.
	That means it had already been logged in.

	If you were now	to access another ExpanDisk drive, such	as J:,
	you'd hear the click because this drive	had never been previously
	accessed, and therefore, must be logged	in.  This drive	will now
	become the ``writable''	drive, and I: will join	A: as being read-
	only.  All disks loaded	into the mount drive will now be compared
	to the directory information obtained from the J: disk,	and if
	they do	not match, that	drive will also	be set to R/O.


	5.5.1  Recovering from Disk Full

	Did you	ever run out of	disk space or get a bad	sector message
	while you were running a program?  This	is a rather common
	occurrence and can often cause the loss	of valuable data, and
	maybe hours worth of work.  You	can't swap disks while the program
	is still running because CP/M detects the change and doesn't allow
	you to write to	that disk.  What do you	do if you have only one
	drive, or your second drive also doesn't have enough space?

	The solution is	simple and effective.  All you have to do is tell
	the program to save your file on one of	the ExpanDisk drives, and
	load a fresh diskette.	The new	disk will appear to be in a
	functional drive, and CP/M will	allow you to write to it.  Your
	data will be saved, and	so will	your time.

	To illustrate, let's say you were writing a program in BASIC, as:

		<A:00> basic
		Welcome	to BASIC Version X.XX
		Ok
		10 print "hello, world"
		20 end
		run
		hello, world
		Ok





				       5-8





	ConIX Operating	System					     Files

	If you wanted to save your program on disk, you'd type:

		Ok
		save "FIRST"
		Disk Full!
		Ok

	BASIC would then attempt to save your program in the file
	A:0/FIRST.BAS.	The Disk Full! message indicates that there is no
	space available	on drive A.  In	that case, just	type:

		Ok
		save "I:FIRST"
		A: disk	in A: drive - load I: disk
		Ok

	ConIX detected that you	referenced an ExpanDisk	drive, and printed
	the ``load'' message, allowing you to swap in a	new diskette and
	save the file.

	When you return	to ConIX, you will be greeted with another load
	message	since your default directory was A:, and that disk is not
	currently in the mount drive.


	5.6  Notes

	1) When	using File or Extension	Searching, it is recommended that
	   the path-login feature be enabled for commands that use the
	   CP/M	Disk-Reset SysCall.  For example, WordStar, before opening
	   any files, will first reset the disk	system,	thereby	disabling
	   all drives except the one being used.  Therefore, if	the
	   overlay files are in	the path on B: and you are editing from
	   A:, B: would	be unlogged, and not searched if [F=0] was used.
	   Since this scenario tends to	occur quite often, we recommend
	   using [F=1],	or just	[F] in the options list	for programs such
	   as WordStar that reset all disks during the course of their
	   execution.  Of course, you must be sure that	all disks to be
	   searched in the path	are on-line, or	else a system error may
	   occur.

	2) Some	programs do not	properly handle	the `Disk Full'	condition
	   in order to allow you to retry the save on another drive.  This
	   is a	limitation of the particular program, and not of ConIX.
	   Consult the manuals for your	software to determine if this
	   capability is available.
