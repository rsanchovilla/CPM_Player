A note for CP/M 3.0 (aka CP/M Plus) users:

Take heart!  A version of RESTORE for CP/M 3.0 is on the way 'real soon now'.
At a secret test site in western Canada, George Reding (the man who brought
you SAP for CP/M 3.0 as SAPP) is working feverishly to adapt RESTORE for 
operation under CP/M 3.0.  He is currently modifying RESTORE 1.2 for that 
system; as soon as his adaptation is complete, I will be adding his 
modifications to the current versions of RESTORE and FRESTORE (whatever they 
are at the time).  The check isn't 'in the mail' yet, but at least the 
checkbook is out of the pocket!
