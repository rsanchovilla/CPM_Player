          ----   NOTES  ON  WHM  SOURCE  CODE  ----


1) Unsqueeze the chosen .MQC file to produce a .MAC file e.g. :-

            B>USQ PHONEBOO.MQC

Owners of the Mitek Assembler Package can then

2) Convert the .MAC file to a .Z80 file:-

            B>ZCON PHONEBOO.MAC

3) Rename the .Z80 file so ZAS won't overwrite the original .REL
   file:-

            B>REN PHANEBOO.Z80=PHONEBOO.Z80
                    ^

4) Assemble the .Z80 file to a .REL file using ZAS e.g.:-
            B>ZAS PHANEBOO
   and find errors (aaaghh) in KEYS, NOTEPAD, CALENDAR and
   PHONEBOO (now he tells us !).

5) Fix appropriate errors by editing them from the .Z80 file using
 say EDIT.COM and reassemble with ZAS.COM until you have NO errors.
  The result will be a .REL file which WHM can load and run.

 * The most common error is a duplicate line for BDOS EQU BASE+5  .
   Solution - remove ONE of these lines.
 * Where the line in error is JP NZ,BLKPAGE remove the "E" from
   BLKPAGE to give JP NZ,BLKPAG.
 * Where the line in error is LD 3,255 change the "3" to "E" to
   give LD E,255   (good luck).

6) Rename the appropriate .DAT file where necessary to the SAME
   spelling as for your renamed  .Z80 file e.g.:-

          B>REN PHANEBOO.DAT=PHONEBOO.DAT
                  ^

 7) Enable WHM or WHMT or WHMF if not already enabled:-

          B>WHM B:ON

8) Trigger WHM with CRTL\. Select "O" for other, enter the name
   "PHANEBOO" (8-character names don't require a <CR>; if the name
   is less than 8 characters long terminate it with a <CR>)
   and, if all is going well, you will see PHANEBOO
   (alias PHONEBOO) leap into action !
