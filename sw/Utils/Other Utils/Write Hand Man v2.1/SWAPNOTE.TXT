SWAP NOTE:- (see page 14 of documentation).

When in SWAP mode, the simulated "CP/M" prompt in the SWAP window
indicates which Disk and User Area is active.  Programs that SWAP
can run may be on any disk in the system but must be in the same
User Area as there is currently no way to change the User Area with
the SWAP application.  SWAP also creates a LARGE file when writing
out the suspended application.  Have plenty (>50-60K) free to allow
this to proceed smoothly.
