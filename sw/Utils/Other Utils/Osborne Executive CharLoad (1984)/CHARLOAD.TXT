If  you  want  to  be able to change console character  sets  on  your 
Osborne Executive quickly and conveniently,  then CHARLOAD is for you.  

Suppose  you  have  a  program  that uses  a  special  character  set.  
Previously,  that character set had to be loaded with the OCC-supplied 
CHARGEN  program or somehow be loaded by the program itself.   CHARGEN 
can be a bit clumsy to use quickly,  with all of the menus you have to 
go  through  for even the simplest loading of  a  character  set.   In 
addition,  CHARGEN  cannot  be  set  up in a SUBMIT file  to  do  this 
loading.   CHARGEN may be fine for designing character sets,  but  for 
only loading them,  29K is a lot of disk space to use up.  Loading the 
character  set  within  the  program  that  uses  it  calls  for  some 
specialized programming that is difficult at best and  near-impossible 
in BASIC.

CHARLOAD was written to fill this need.   Its size is just 3K,  and it 
uses  the  familiar command-line structure used  with  PIP.   You  can 
enter:   "CHARLOAD d = s" [where d is where you want the character set 
to  go (destination) and s is where it is to come from  (source)],  or 
you  can  just  enter  "CHARLOAD" to get  a  display  of  the  current 
character sets and a prompt (*) for you to enter a CHARLOAD command.

Using  CHARLOAD  is so simple that the commands can be reduced to  the 
name of the program and one other word.  Example:
     CHARLOAD SPECIAL    will load a character set from the file
                         SPECIAL.CHR to the Alternate character
                         set in memory.
     CHARLOAD $SYSTEM    will restore the Alternate charcater set
                         in memory from the Alternate character set
                         on the System tracks.
