CHARLOAD  is  a companion to the OCC-supplied CHARGEN  Character  Font 
Generator.   It  is a short,  fast program used to load character sets 
from files or System Tracks to either of these or to the Font RAM bank 
in memory.  It does not create character sets.

Advantages of CHARLOAD over CHARGEN for transfering character sets:
1) CHARLOAD is faster to operate than CHARGEN,  since it uses  command 
line instructions rather than a series of menus.
2) CHARLOAD's command line system provides for changing character sets 
in  a SUBMIT file sequence.  
3) CHARLOAD is much  shorter than  CHARGEN (3K rather than 29K) and so 
uses much less disk space.
4)  CHARLOAD can create and use Image format files in addition to  the 
HEX  format files that CHARGEN uses.   These Image format files occupy 
only 2K of disk space rather than the 6K that HEX format character set 
files use.

CHARLOAD uses a command structure similar to that of CP/M's  PIP.   If 
the  program  is  called  without an additional command  on  the  CP/M 
command  line,  both character sets are displayed and a prompt (*)  is 
given for the input of a command.   In this case (as with PIP),  after 
each  command is executed,  another prompt is given until  a  carriage 
return  with  no  other  input is entered.   CP/M  Plus  line  editing 
functions  are active on this input line,  and  lower-case  characters 
will be read as their upper-case equivalents.

The general form of CHARLOAD commands is

     A>CHARLOAD destination = source
                 - or -
     *destination = source

The  destination and/or source may be  filenames,  following  standard 
CP/M  Plus conventions of d:filename.typ,  where the drive  identifier 
(d:) and filetype (.typ) are optional.  If the filetype is left blank, 
default  values  are assigned,  as described below.   Blank names  and 
wildcards are not allowed.

If no filetype is given for a source file,  first .CHR is tried,  and, 
if a file with that name is not found,  filetype .IMG is tried.  If no 
filetype is given for a destination file, filetype .CHR is assigned if 
the  file is to be in HEX format and filetype .IMG is assigned if  the 
file is to be in Image format.  (See below for format descriptions.)

Two pseudo-filenames can be used with CHARLOAD.  $SYSTEM indicates the 
System Tracks,  and may be preceeded by a drive  identifier.   $SYSTEM 
should  not  be  used in reference to a drive that is  not  using  the 
standard  Osborne Executive format.   $FONTRAM indicates the Font  RAM 
bank in memory.   $FONTRAM may not be used as a source, as this memory 
section is "write-only" memory.   Only the first letter after the $ is 
checked,  so  these may be abbreviated as $S and $F.   No other  names 
starting with a dollar sign ($) are  permitted.   (Note:  Use a double
dollar sign for these names in SUBMIT files, e.g. $$SYSTEM to refer to
the System Tracks.   This is because the  $ character in a SUBMIT file
usually indicates a SUBMIT variable.)

If a single name is given on a command line (with no = sign), CHARLOAD 
assumes that this is the source and that the destination is $FONTRAM.

CHARLOAD  uses two storage formats.   Image format is an image of  the 
character set definition information in font RAM,  and is always 2K in 
length.   (Each character definition occupies 16 bytes:   The first 10 
represent  the 10 8-bit rows of each character;  the last 6 bytes  are 
not  used.   See  the  Osborne  Executive  Reference  Guide  for  more 
information.)   System Track character sets are always stored in  this 
form, as are, of course, font RAM sets.  With CHARLOAD, files may also 
be in this form, though CHARGEN will NOT be able to read such files.

HEX  format files are stored in Intel HEX format.   Files  created  by 
CHARGEN are in this format and each is a full HEX format definition of 
all of the bytes in the font RAM,  including unused bytes.   HEX files 
converted  from Image source by CHARLOAD are also in this full format.  
Shorter  HEX format files may be created by assemblers or other  means 
that  do not include these unused bytes or character definitions  that 
are  not required.   These can be loaded by CHARLOAD,  but may not  be 
compatible with CHARGEN. 

CHARLOAD  determines the format to use by the filetype or by  optional 
specifiers.   Unless otherwise specified,  the format is assumed to be 
HEX if the filetype is .CHR or .HEX.   Otherwise the format is assumed 
to be Image.   To specify one format or the other, follow the filename 
with [H] to specify HEX format or [I] to specify Image format.   The H 
specifier  may not be used with $SYSTEM or $FONTRAM names and H and  I 
specifiers may not be used with the same file.

Unless otherwise specified,  CHARLOAD assumes that $SYSTEM or $FONTRAM 
refer to the Alternate character set.   To specify the Main  character 
set, follow the name with [M].  To specify the Alternate character set 
explicitly,  follow  the  name with [A].   Where both the  source  and 
destination  names  are $SYSTEM or $FONTRAM,  if one has  A  and/or  M 
specifiers  and  the  other  has  none,   CHARLOAD  assumes  the  same 
specification  for both.   The A and M specifiers may not be used with 
files.  

If  both  A and M specifiers are used [AM],  the  resulting  operation 
depends on the type of names in the instruction.   If both are $SYSTEM 
or  $FONTRAM,  then  both  character  sets  are  transfered  to  their 
respective locations.  If the source is $SYSTEM and the destination is 
a  file,  only  the Main character set will be loaded from the  System 
Tracks  to the file.   If the source is a file and the destination  is 
$SYSTEM or $FONTRAM, the file will be loaded to both character sets.

Specifiers  must be enclosed in square brackets and must  not  include 
any  characters  other than the described specifier letters or  spaces 
or  tabs.   Spaces and/or tabs may be used in anywhere in the  command 
line  except  within  names  to  improve  legibility.   No  extraneous 
characters or comments may be included within or following the command 
on the command line. 

Some examples of CHARLOAD commands and their functions:

 A>CHARLOAD                <-- Run CHARLOAD, display current character
                             sets in memory, issue * prompt.
 *$FONTRAM=OCCFONT         <-- Load OCCFONT.CHR (possibly OCCFONT.IMG)
                             into the Alternate character set in memory.
 *$FONTRAM[M]=MAIN.IMG     <-- Load MAIN.IMG into the Main character set
                             in memory.
 *A:$SYSTEM=B:$SYSTEM[AM]  <-- Copy the System Track fonts from drive B:
                             onto drive A:.
 *NEWFONT=$SYSTEM[M]       <-- Create file NEWFONT.CHR with System Track
                             Main character set loaded in HEX format.

 A>CHARLOAD GAMEFONT       <-- Load GAMEFONT.CHR (possibly GAMEFONT.IMG)
                             into the Alternate character set in memory.
 A>CHARLOAD $SYSTEM        <-- Restore the Alternate character set in 
                             memory from the Alternate character set on 
                             the System Tracks.
 (The last two examples represent common uses for setting up a special  
 character set and restoring to normal following its use.)

In  CHARLOAD  prompt  mode,  messages are displayed as  each  step  is 
performed,  advising  the  user  of  the  sequence  performed.   These 
messages indicate what the program is reading, converting and writing.  
Also,  when  the  font RAM is written,  the contents of  that  section 
written  is  displayed.   This  information is not shown in  the  CP/M 
command line mode.  

Error  messages  are  shown  in  both  modes  and  are  fairly   self-
explanatory.   "Destination  name  error",  "Source name  error",  and 
"Specifier  error"  indicate unexpected or prohibited  input  in  that 
section  of  the command line.   "HEX Format error" indicates  that  a 
source   file   being  converted  was  not  in  proper   HEX   format.  
"Insufficient  disk  space"  and "Directory full"  are  also  possible 
indications.   These are "soft" errors and will return to the CHARLOAD 
prompt  if  in that mode.   Other disk function errors  (read,  write, 
etc.)  are considered fatal and will terminate CHARLOAD in  any  mode.  
These  include attempts to write to a write-protected disk.   Many  of 
these will first be intercepted by the Executive BIOS,  which will ask 
if a re-try is wanted.   If a "No" answer is given to this,  the error 
will  be  trapped  by the BDOS or by CHARLOAD for exit to  the  system 
prompt.

If  a  source  file is not found,  this will  be  indicated.   If  the 
filetype entered was blank,  after not finding filename.CHR,  CHARLOAD 
tries filename.IMG.   Only after both are not found does the  function 
terminate.  Note that under CP/M Plus, if the file is not found in the 
current user area, it is automatically searched for as a SYS attribute 
file in User area 0, and if found there, can be read.

If  a file to be written exists,  the user will be asked whether it is 
"OK  to  overwrite?  (Y/N)".   An  affirmative reply  will  cause  the 
original file to be deleted and replaced by the new file.   No back-up 
is made.   A negative reply terminates the function and returns to the 
appropriate prompt.   If such a file exists and is Read/only,  this is 
indicated  and  the  function terminated.   If it  is  Password  write 
protected,  and  the  required  password is not  in  effect,  this  is 
indicated and the function is terminated.
