Enter up to five program names (in a total of 19 characters or less)
for the eXecute CMD "program list".

For each program enter:

      *  Program Name (without the .COM suffix), followed by <RETURN>

      *  Update the file ChgDte (y/n)?

      *  Pass the full filename (y/n)?
           y = Full filename (e.g. SAMPLE.BAS)
           n = Filename portion only (eg. SAMPLE)
         Note:  If you are unsure, reply "y"

If you want to enter less than five program names, enter just
the <RETURN> key when prompted for a program name.

Change the "program list" at any time by re-running the PROGLIST program.
