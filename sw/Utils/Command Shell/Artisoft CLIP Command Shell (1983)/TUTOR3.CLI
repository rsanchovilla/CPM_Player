WRITE TUTOR3 - Learning how to use the calculator
WRITE
WRITE The built-in calculator that CLIP contains is meant to be used
WRITE for command line calculations, macro looping, or radix conversions.
WRITE Being a 16 bit integer calculator you might be hard pressed to use
WRITE it to balance your checkbook but it has been done!
WRITE
WRITE If you are used to a Hewlett-Packard calculator or any other RPN
WRITE calculator, you will find the CALC command to be a breeze.
WRITE
WRITE CALC is an RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) calculator with a ten level
WRITE stack.  This means 10 levels of parens may be handled.
WRITE
WRITE Take this calculation: (2+3)*(4+5+6*(12-10))
WRITE The command to figure this out would be:
RADIX 10
WRITE CALC 2 3 + 4 5 6 12 10 - * + + *
CALC 2 3 + 4 5 6 12 10 - * + + *
WRITE
READ/1/P [Type return to continue]
WRITE
WRITE This tutorial cannot hope to describe the RPN system, please refer
WRITE to a text on this subject.
WRITE
WRITE Storing calculations into memory for future retrieval is accomplished
WRITE by a simple switch on the CALC command:
WRITE
WRITE CALC/1 2 3 + 4 5 6 12 10 - * + + *
CALC/1 2 3 + 4 5 6 12 10 - * + + *
WRITE
WRITE Now the number %V/1% is stored in variable number 1.
STRING/2 %ASCII 25%
WRITE
READ/1/P [Type return to continue]
WRITE
WRITE This variable may be retrieved into a command line at any time by
WRITE using the internal macro %S/2%V/1%S/2%.  Wherever this macro is seen
WRITE by CLIP, it will be expanded to the current value of the variable.
WRITE
WRITE CALC/1 %S/2%V/1%S/2% 1 +
WRITE
WRITE will increment variable number 1.
