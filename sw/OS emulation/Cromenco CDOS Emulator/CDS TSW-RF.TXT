                       TSW Software Interface
                            Version 1.01
        
        
             The  TSW software interface allows the owners of.Cromemco
        hardware and software to use the popular CP/M** operating system.
        The considerable software investment of your Cromemco system can
        now be transferred directly to a CP/M load module to run under
        the CP/M operating system
        
             To use the CDS module to temporarily execute a Cromemco
        program just type the letters CDS preceeding the normal Cromemco
        command line.  For example, to assemble the program EXAMPLE.Z80
        with an unmodified Cromemco assembler the following command line
        could be used:
        
                A>CDS ASMB EXAMPLE
        
             To temporarily execute the unmodified Cromemco FORTRAN
        compiler to compile the program ROOTS.FOR the following command
        lines could be used:
        
                A>CDS FOR
                *=ROOTS
        
             The program MAKCOM can be used to create a modified version
        of a program which will directly execute under the CP/M operating
        system. The inputs to the MAKCOM program are the input Cromemco
        compatible load module name and the desired new module name.  The
        input file name and output file name must be different.  For
        example to modify the Cromemco assembler to run under CP/M, the
        following command line could be used:
        
                A>MAKCOM  ASMB CPMASMB
        
         NOTE: CPMASMB.COM WOULD NOW BE A MODIFIED VERSION AND MUST
               NOT BE USED AS AN INPUT TO MAKCOM OR ELSE THE
               RESULTANT LOAD MODULE WOULD NOT EXECUTE  PROPERLY ON
               EITHER A CP/M OR CROMEMCO OPERATING SYSTEM
        
             To assemble the program EXAMPLE.Z80 with the modified
        assembler the following command line could be used:
        
                A>CPMASMB EXAMPLE
        
        
        
        
        
        
        ** CP/M is a registered trade mark of Digital Research
        





        
        
        
                      TSW Software Interface
        
                       Version 1.01
        
        
              For another example, to create a modified version of the
        FORTRAN compiler the routine MAKCOM could be used as follows:
        
        
                A>MAKCOM FOR.COM CPMFOR.COM
        
             To compile the program ROOTS.FOR with the modified FORTRAN
        compiler, the following commands could now be used:
        
                A>CPMFOR
        
                *=ROOTS
        
        
        
        The  TSW  Software Interface Version 1.01 is now compatible with
        all current Cromemco software (with the exceptionof multi-user
        basic)
