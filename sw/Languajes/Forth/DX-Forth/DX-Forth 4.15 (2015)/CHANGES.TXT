                          IMPORTANT CHANGES

This document discusses changes to DX-Forth for CP/M that may adversely
affect previously written programs.  It is recommended users update their
programs to the latest DX-Forth version.  See WHATSNEW.TXT for a summary
of other changes and additions.


v4.10

   ALLOT has been changed (for the better).  Unlike Forth-94 ALLOT only
   unsigned values may be used.  Applications which used negative values
   with ALLOT should be changed to use -ALLOT instead.  Programs which
   require Forth-94 behaviour can be accommodated with the following
   redefinition:

     : ALLOT ( n -- )  NEGATE -ALLOT ;

   Note however that memory checking is not performed.
