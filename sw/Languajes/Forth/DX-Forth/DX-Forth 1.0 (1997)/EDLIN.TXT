-----------

EDLIN is a simple line-oriented screen editor.

It uses the same commands as the editor in 'Starting Forth' and 
is a slightly modified version of the editor that appeared in 
Forth Dimensions III/3.

Editing of screens with a line editor is rather tedious and is 
best avoided (see EDITOR.SCR for a full-screen editor).  However 
it does have the advantage that it does not need to be installed 
and works with any video terminal.


General screen commands:
------------------------

 EDIT  ( -- u )

     Enter the EDITOR vocabulary and select screen u for editing.  
     The cursor is positioned at the start of line 0.  All editor 
     commands (see below) are then available for use.

 WHERE  ( -- )                                         S

     Used after a LOAD error, WHERE performs the same function as 
     EDIT but the screen and the cursor position are 
     automatically set to the location where the error occured.

 L  ( -- )          List                               S

     Lists the current screen.  The screen number is obtained 
     from the variable SCR and is set by LIST, EDIT or when a 
     LOAD error occurs.

 N  ( -- )          Next                               S

     Increments the screen number by one.  Typically used 
     immediately before the L command.

 B  ( -- )          Back                               S

     Decrements the screen number by one.  Typically used 
     immediately before the L command.

 COPY  ( u1 u2 -- )                                    S

     Copy the contents of screen u1 to screen u2.

 COPIES  ( u1 u2 u3 -- )                               S

     Copy a range of screens - u1 is the first source screen, u2 
     is the first destination screen, u3 is the number of screens 
     to be copied.  The user is prompted before copying begins.  
     Pressing any key during copy aborts the process.  Overlap of 
     source and destination screens is automatically handled.


Editor commands:
----------------
(these commands are available only from the EDITOR vocabulary)

Note: for commands that allow it, text input is not mandatory.  
If no text follows the command then the current contents of 
either the FIND or INSERT buffer (according to the command) will 
be used instead.


 ?  ( -- )                                             S

     Display the current line and cursor position.

 ^  ( -- )                                             S

     Used as terminator for all commands allowing text input.  
     Allows more than one command to be used on a line.

 T  ( u -- )        Type                               S

     Type line u from the current screen and select it as the 
     current line.

 P text  ( -- )     Put                                S

     Copies any following text into the INSERT buffer and the 
     string is put into the current line replacing its previous 
     contents.  If P is followed by two or more blanks then the 
     entire line will be erased.

 X  ( -- )          Extract                            S

     Copies the current line into the INSERT buffer and then 
     extracts it from the block.  All following lines are moved 
     up.

 TILL text  ( -- )                                     S

     Copies any following text into the FIND buffer and deletes 
     all characters from the current cursor position up till and 
     including the string.

 I text  ( -- )     Insert                             S

     Copies any following text into the INSERT buffer and inserts 
     the string just behind the cursor.  Any text pushed off the 
     end of the line will be lost.

 F text  ( -- )     Find                               S

     Copies any following text into the FIND buffer and finds the 
     string in the remainder of the block.  The F command with no 
     following text behaves as the N command.

 E  ( -- )          Erase                              S

     Erases backwards from the cursor as many characters as are 
     currently in the FIND buffer.  To be used after the F 
     command.

 D text  ( -- )     Delete                             S

     Copies any following text into the FIND buffer then finds 
     the next occurrence of the string within the line and 
     deletes it.  The D command is a combination of the F and E 
     commands.

 R text  ( -- )     Replace                            S

     Copies any following text into the INSERT buffer.  Combines 
     the E and I commands to replace a found string with a given 
     string or the contents of the INSERT buffer.

 U text  ( -- )     Under                              S

     Copies any following text into the INSERT buffer and puts 
     the string into the line under the current line.  All 
     following lines are pushed down and line 15 is lost.

 S text  ( u -- )   Search                             S

     Copies any following text into the FIND buffer then searches 
     from the top of current block to the end of block u-1 for 
     the string, displaying the lines and location where a match 
     occurs.

 M  ( u1 u2 -- )    Move                               S

     Copies the current line into the INSERT buffer and moves a 
     copy of the INSERT buffer into the line UNDER the line u2 of 
     block u1.  The current line is incremented by one.  This 
     allows sequential lines to be moved with a minimum of 
     keystrokes.

 WIPE  ( -- )                                          S

     Wipes the current screen by setting its contents to blanks.
