(Last Minute) Notes to purchasers of Z-80 FORTH
-----------------------------------------------

Printed  documentation  in  user's  manual  was updated 20 March 1981.
This file updated 20 March 1981.

This disk contains Z-80 FORTH version 1.13.  Please carefully read the
user  documentation  before  you  begin  using  the  interpreter.   We
strongly recommend that you copy the files onto a fresh disk for daily
use,   and   store  the  distribution  disk  as  a  backup.   If  your
distribution disk is damaged by a software or  hardware  accident  and
the  files  cannot  be  recovered,  return  it  with  $6.00 for media,
shipping, and handling and a replacement disk will be sent to you.

The  following  procedure  may  be  used to install Z-80 FORTH on your
system.  

	1.  Place a  diskette  on  drive  A  containing  the
	    operating  system  and  a  copy  of  the Digital
	    Research program SUBMIT.  The diskette must have
	    at least 150 kbytes of free space.
	2.  Place the FORTH distribution diskette  in  drive
	    B, and type control/C (^C) to log on the disk.
	3.  In response to the CP/M cue, type:

	    A>submit b:forth.sub

	4.  Wait  for  the  transfer operations to complete.
	    The documentation files are  not  copied  during
	    this operation.

If you have questions or require technical assistance, please call Ray
Duncan  at  (213)  390-9292  or write to Laboratory Microsystems, 4147
Beethoven Street, Los Angeles, CA 90066.

We expect to release version 1.14 of Z-80 FORTH in  June,  1981.   The
new  package  will  include  full  floating  point  arithmetic, screen
auto-load at cold start, and expanded disk handling capabilities.  The
new package will be completely  upward  compatible  from  the  current
version  1.13.   A  hardware  assist S-100 board incorporating the AMD
9511 processor will be available for applications requiring  extremely
high speed floating point calculations.  Owners of the current version
of  Z-80 FORTH will be able to purchase an update to version 1.14 at a
discounted price.

Several  new  applications are under development including a data base
management package.  Those who purchased Z-80 FORTH by mail are on our
mailing list and will be notified automatically when the new  software
is  released.  If you obtained Z-80 FORTH from a retail outlet and you
wish to be added to the mailing list, send your name  and  address  to
4147 Beethoven Street, Los Angeles, CA 90066.

Your comments and  suggestions  for  improving  Z-80  FORTH  are  most
welcome!

The utility SCOPY.COM has been  recently  added  to  the  distribution
disk.  This program may be used to transfer FORTH text screens between
two  existing disk files, or to create new screen files.  The inherent
cues and error messages make  use  of  the  program  self-explanatory.
There  is a slight error in the User's guide regarding console inputs:
only filenames and screen numbers need be terminated with  a  carriage
return.   Single character responses do not require a carriage return.
The screen number may be one to three digits.  If not supplied by  the
user,  the  disk  drive  defaults  to  the current drive, and the file
extension defaults to ".SCR".  An  example  of  program  execution  is
given below:

	B>scopy

	Z-80 FORTH Screen Copy Utility version 1.0
	(c) 1981 Laboratory Microsystems

	Enter source file name:		forth
	Enter destination file name:	user

	Source file = 			b:forth.scr
	Destination file = 		b:user.scr

	OK to proceed? (Y/N)		> y

	Destination file not found.
	Should it be created? (Y/N)	> y

	Files opened.

	Enter screen number:		> 4      
	Screen # 0004 transferred.

	Another screen? (Y/N)		> n

	Goodbye.
