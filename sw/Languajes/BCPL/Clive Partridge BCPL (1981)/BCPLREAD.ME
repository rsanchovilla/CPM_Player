
The following is a quick note on extensions provided to MicroBcpl.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

If you already have a standard system, note that %DRIVE2, %BRTS, and
%RTS2 all have small additions, and that LIBHDR is expanded.

Random file handling is on the way - via a 'C' style seek() - some
patches to DRIVE2 and RTS2 have been made in readiness. e.g. the file
control blocks are now four bytes longer.

String Handling  -  needs %TEXT, %STRG, %XTRA
---------------

Bdos  calls - now built into the standard runtimes in %RTS2
-----------
Bios  calls - need %BIOS1 and %BIOS2
-----------

Chaining programs -  needs %FILES, %EXEC, %CHAIN
----------------- 

Dynamic memory allocation - in %FREE
-------------------------

For expanded machines only
==========================

Make ROM calls (Zcalls) - needs %ZCALL, & ZHDR
------------------------

Using paged I/O  - needs zcalls and %PIO, %SYS1 and SYSHDR
---------------

Pageing from highlevel - needs %SYS1,%SYS2 and SYSHDR
----------------------
