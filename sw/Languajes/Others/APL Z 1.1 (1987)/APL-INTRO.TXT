                         APL/Z

An APL interpreter for Z80 systems under CP/M. By S. Gownowicz. I don't
know much about the origins of this, which came from Europe, but it does
work and appears to be bug-free. An APL character terminal is required;
these vary a bit, so two lookup tables are provided (locations 700H and
F00H for input and output respectively) so that any character may be
associated with any code. The APL seems to be quite standard; all the
examples given in Gilman and Rose run correctly. It's also quite fast.
 Also included a number of utilities in APL for complex number math,
hyperbolic functions and Jacobean elliptic functions. Some of the more
esoteric APL functions are in the form of overlays which may be omitted
if not required, freeing workspace for programs.

Overlays is not the right word for the *.ACO files, rather these are
derived functions which are pulled in with the {copy command.  {copy
works differently here than in APL.SV, in that it works on specific
files one at a time -- more like APL360.  These files must have been
explicitly saved with the {csave command.  {clib gives the directory
of {copy -able files in the same manner as {lib for workspaces.
  To be more specific about the character translation tables at 700h
and 0f00h, the input table is 256 bytes, so it is possible to use
the program with an ascii terminal.  The first table translates ascii
to apl internal code, and the second from internal code to ascii.
As it stands now, it emulates an apl keyboard so the functions are
all where you would expect to find them -- e.g. shift-k = single quote,
shift-2 = unary minus.  If you do use an ascii keyboard, you will want
to remap some keys so the output will be easier to read.
