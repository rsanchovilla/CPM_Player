* RECEIVE <variable list>
Transfers values of variables from "GOPROC" or "RETURN" statement
to <variable list>.  The variables on the list are filled in
the same order that the variables appear on the GOPROC or RETURN
statement.  Examples:  RECEIVE X    RECEIVE RES$,ANSWER

REM[anything]
Allows insertion of remarks in the program text.  The remarks
must follow the REM statement on the same line.
Examples:  REM   THIS PROGRAM CALCULATES TRIG TABLES
           REMARK   READ THE FILE FROM CASSETTE.

RESTORE [<line identifier>]
Sets the READ DATA pointer to the first data statement, or,
optionally, to the statement <line identifier>.  This allows
reading seperate tables or seperate portions of a table without
having to read through all DATA statements.
Examples:  RESTORE      RESTORE TABLE2       RESTORE START+5

RETURN [<variable list>]
Causes execution to continue at the statement following the last
"GOSUB" statement executed.  If the optional variable list is
included, passes the values of the variables on the list to
the variables on the list of a "RECEIVE" statement.
Examples:  RETURN    RETURN N    RETURN X$,ANSWER,RESULT$

STOP
Terminates execution of the BASIC program, and returns
back to the command mode.  Example:  STOP

WAIT <expr1>,<expr2>,<expr3>
An input from port <expr1> is performed.  The byte received
is XOR'd with <expr3> if included, and AND'ed with <expr2>.
The above operation is repeated until a non-zero result is
obtained, upon which the next statement is executed.
Example:  WAIT 0,1    WAIT PORT,MASK,INVERT
