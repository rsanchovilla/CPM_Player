* CSAVE!
Causes TARBELL BASIC to write itself and optionally,  system monitor
onto cassette tape.  This is handy for making patches.
Example:	CSAVE!

* DELETE <line descriptor> [<line descriptor>]
Eliminates the line(s) indicated from the stored program.  If only
the first <line descriptor> is present, only that one line is deleted.
If both <line descriptor>'s are present, both those lines, and
all lines in between are deleted.  If there is no such line
descriptor, an error message is issued.
Examples:	DELETE START+4	    DELETE LOOP LOOP+5

* ENTER [<line descriptor>]  or  :[<line descriptor>]
Causes TARBELL BASIC to go to program entry mode.  Any input after
this statement is interpreted as program statements.  A carriage
return delimits each line.  The "ENTER" statement is provided to
allow statements without names to be entered.  If <line descriptor>
is ommitted, entry begins after the last statement currently in
memory.  If <line descriptor> is present, entry begins immediately before
the line indicated.  Entry mode is terminated by two carriage returns 
in a row.  Multiple statements per line are allowed if separated by a colon.
The colon shown in the command format above, however, is a shorthand
form of ENTER, the same way that "?" is a shorthand form of PRINT.
The first line in a program should always have a label.
If any of the following commands are invoked from entry mode, they
will be performed, then command mode will be reentered:
  LIST,DELETE,EDIT,RUN.
Examples:	ENTER	    ENTER ADDC+3     ENTER LOOP     : START+1

LIST [<line descriptor>] [<line descriptor>]
Lists the program starting from the statement corresponding with
the first <line descriptor>, until the end is reached, if there is no
second <line descriptor>, or until a control/C is entered.
If neither <line descriptor> is present, the whole program is listed.
Examples:	LIST     LIST START+10     LIST LOOP END1

NEW
Deletes the program in memory, clears all variables, releases all
string and array space.  Example:   NEW

RUN [<line descriptor>]
If the line descriptor is included, starts execution of the BASIC
program at the line specified.  If the line descriptor is ommitted,
execution begins at the first line in memory.  In either case, a
CLEAR is automatically executed first.
Examples:   RUN		RUN COMD	RUN SUBROUTINE+1

* SYMBOL
Types a table of variable names, line descriptors, their types and
their locations.  Example:	SYMBOL
