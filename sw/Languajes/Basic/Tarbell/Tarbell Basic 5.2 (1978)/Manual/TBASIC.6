Statements:

* ASSIGN <logical device number>,<physical device number>
Assigns a physical device to a logical device.  Internally,
this command sets a bit in the MODES table.  See Appendix E
for a list of the logical and physical devices.
Examples:  ASSIGN 3,1   ASSIGN PR,CRT   ASSIGN LOGICAL,PHYSICAL

* BGET <variable name>
Reads from Binary Input logical device into named variable.
Example:   BGET ITEM(N)   BGET X   BGET ARRAY(X,Y)

* BLOAD <string expression>
Reads a program named <string expression> into memory from the
binary input logical device.  All characters of string are used.
Examples:   BLOAD "PAYROLL"   BLOAD PROGNAME$

* BPUT <variable name>
Writes the named variable onto the binary output logical device.
Examples:   BPUT ITEM(N)   BPUT X   BPUT ARRAY(X,Y)

* BSAVE <string expression>
Writes a program named <string expression> onto the binary output
logical device.  All characters of the string are used.
Example:  BSAVE "PAYROLL"    BSAVE PROGNAME$

CHANNEL
Prints a table of the assignments of physical to logical
devices.  See Appendix E for the default assignments.

DATA <expression list>
Specifies data to be read by a "READ" statement.  Expressions
are allowed.  String constants must be enclosed by quotes.
Example:  DATA 1,3,5,7,X+Y,Z^2,"DON"+"TARBELL"

DEF FN<function name>(<variable list>)=<expression>
Defines a function.  The function name can be any legal variable
name.  The variable list is a list of dummy variables representing
the variables in the function call.  The value of the function is
determined by substituting the values of the variables into the
expression.  Functions may be nested to any depth, and string
functions are legal.  Any number of variables can be used.
Examples:   DEF FNCUBE(X)=X*X*X   DEF FNL3(S$)=LEFT$(S$,3)
	    DEF FNRMS(X,Y) = SQR(X^2+Y^2)

DIM <array name>(integer)[,<array name>(integer)]...
Allocates space for array variables.  Any number of dimensions
per array are allowed. The value of each expression gives the
maximum subscript permissible.  The smallest is 0.  If no "DIM"
statement is encountered before a reference to an array,
an error message is given.  Multiple arrays may be dimensioned.
Arrays are cleared to zero (numeric) or null (string).  Real
subscripts are allowed in array references, and if used, the
integer part of the subscript will be used for the reference.
Examples:  DIM PARTNO$(100),X(3,10),VERYLONGNAMESAREALLOWED(5)
