This manual describes TARBELL BASIC in such a way as to be
understood by those having previous experience with other BASIC's.
It is not intended as a tutorial, as there are several good 
BASIC texts (see Appendix K).  Where reasonable it is
upward compatible from ALTAIR* 8800 BASIC release 4.0 8k version.
Items which differ significantly from that version are marked
with an asterisk.  Items enclosed in angles (<item>) are defined
in Appendix B.  Items enclosed in brackets ([item]) are optional.

Control Characters are rubout to delete a character, Ctl-U to
delete the line being entered, Ctl-C to stop the program or listing,
carriage-return for end of entry, Ctl-I to tab 8 spaces, and
Ctl-S to cause the program or printing to stop temporarily.

Modes of Operation:

    Direct Mode:
	Most TARBELL BASIC statements may be entered and executed while
	in command level.  This statement may be only one line, but
	may be any length up to the limits of memory.  Statements which
	would modify allocated memory, such as DIM & LET, are not allowed
	in direct mode entries.  Statement names are not allowed.
	Multiple statements per line may be seperated by colons (:).

    Entry Mode:
	This mode is entered by typing "ENTER" or ":", and is
	used for creating lines of program text from the keyboard.
	it is also used for inserting lines.  See ENTER command.

    Edit Mode:
	This mode is entered by typing "EDIT" and a line descriptor.
	It is used for making changes to existing lines without
	having to retype the whole line.  See EDIT command.

    Run Mode:
	This is the normal, programmed mode.  The stored TARBELL
	BASIC program begins executing when a "RUN" command is entered.

To acquire a better feel for the modes of operation, and for using
TARBELL BASIC in general, see the sample run in Appendix F.
