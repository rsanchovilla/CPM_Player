These are the files as found on the Computer Language SIG on the Micronet.
Unfortunatly, there was no documentation.  Most of what documentation there
is, is in the file BCBC.PRO which is the 'structured' BASIC version.

Also, the compiler will not compile itself because of certain statements
like DEFINT and DEF FN.  That's really too bad.  The ultimate test of a
compiler is to write it in the language it compiles.  However, this version
1.0 and was written in 1983, so maybe Mr. Tonklin has improved it.  I haven't
heard anything about newer versions.  Also, there is an address in the 
BCBC.PRO file where you can write for a manual ($10.00).  I never sent for
it because I read the source and got a good feel for what it expects.
A good rule of thumb, is don't get too complicated with expressions.

I can't say much for the error messages the compiler generates.  It gives
you an error at the compiled code address, not the offending line number.
I always compile with the FULL DOCUMENTATION option.  Then at least I can
check the .ASM file for the problem line.

This certainly isn't BASCOM but what the heck, it's free.

enjoy...
