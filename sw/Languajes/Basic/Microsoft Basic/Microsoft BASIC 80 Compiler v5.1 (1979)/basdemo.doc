		   THE MICROSOFT BASIC COMPILER
 
	The Microsoft BASIC Compiler is a powerful new tool for
programming BASIC applications.  It produces relocatable
machine code in a single pass of the source file.  Its source
language is effectively identical to the Microsoft BASIC-80
interpreter, version 5.0.
 
	The compiler makes it possible to develop applications
with the Microsoft BASIC-80 interpreter and compile them to make
more efficient use of system resources.

	The BASIC COMPARISON program by Lifeboat Associates is
a good example of this usage.  It was developed with the interpreter
making it much easier to trace and debug.  When the program ran without
error, it was saved with the "A" option, compiled with the compiler,
linked and loaded. Its execution in machine code form is identical to
that of the interpreter with these exceptions:
 
	-  It is at least five times faster!
	-  It uses only 16K bytes of memory rather 
	   than a total of 27K bytes!
 
	The interpreter is not required for program development,
as source language text files can be edited directly if it is
not available.
 
	The compiler requires CP/M and at least 36K of memory.
It is furnished with MACRO-80, LINK-80, CREF-80 and LIB-80.
The relocatable files produced are compatible with those produced
by MACRO-80, COBOL-80 and FORTRAN-80.  It is particularly easy to
link to subroutines in other languages through the CALL statement
in Microsoft BASIC version 5.0.

	The BASIC COMPILER/INTERPRETER COMPARISON program 
demonstrates the language compatibility and the size and
speed comparisons of these program development tools.
It is available with the BASIC-80 interpreter, or as part
of an update to BASIC-80 from Lifeboat Associates.
