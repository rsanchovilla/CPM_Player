Dear Customer,

This disk contains useful public-domain (can be copied) CP/M
compatible software.

CBIOS24.ASM - Standard input/output system for Tarbell CP/M
and Tarbell Floppy Disk Interface (FDI).  Notice that there
is now a VDM-1 driver in it, which may be activated by
setting the proper EQU's.

SBOOT24.ASM - Source for the standard Tarbell FDI coldstart
loader program, set up for 24k.

COPY.COM, COPY.ASM - Command and source files for a copy
program from the CP/M user's group, which has been
modified to work with the Tarbell FDI.  To use it, type
"COPY ALL", "COPY SYSTEM", or "COPY DATA".
After typing in the command, it will come back and wait
for a carriage-return so you can put your master and
fresh disks in.  The first form copies the whole disk,
track by track, from A to B.  The second form copies
just the first two tracks, and the third copies all
but the first two tracks.  After it comes back with the
ending message, a carriage-return will do a warm boot,
and an ampersand (&) followed by a carriage-return will
repeat the operation.

TAPELIB.COM, TAPELIB.DOC are the command file and
documentation packages for an extensive Tarbell Cassette
Interface-CP/M tape library system, written by
Sam Singer.  It provides capabilities similar to the
new PIP, only for cassette tape.  For example, you
can dump all the files, or all the .ASM files to cassette.

DSKCAS.ASM, CASDSK.ASM - These are the sources for simple
Tarbell Cassette-CP/M transfers.  They are somewhat
inefficient compared to those of TAPELIB, since they
use only 128-byte buffers.  They are used by typing:
DSKCAS filename , or CASDSK filename.  Of course they
have to be assembled first.

FORMAT.ASM - This program, written by Dick Culbertson,
allows you to completely format a blank or crashed disk.
It wipes out whatever is on the disk, so be sure you
have all the information off the disk that you need.  Also
be sure to remove the disk you have in drive A and
only have the one you want reformatted in there, when it
comes up with it's opening message.  This program also
needs assembling before use.

FBIOS24.ASM - This is the assembly-language source for the
dual PerSci version of the Basic Input/Output System.  It
is usually the same as the standard version, except for the
DUAL and FAST EQU statements.  Notice that it also contains
a VDM driver.  Follow the procedure in the CP/M
operating system notes entitled "Making Changes in the CP/M
System" in order to integrate this module into your system.

FBOOT24.ASM - This is the assembly-language source for the
dual PerSci version of the coldstart loader program.

BASIC.COM, RUN.COM - These are the command modules for 
the BASIC-E compiler and run-time interpreter, written by
Gordon Eubanks, Jr.

DISKTEST.ASM - THIS PROGRAM READS THE ENTIRE DISK
AND CHECKS IT FOR ERRORS. BE SURE TO EDIT THE SOURCE
AND CHANGE THE EQU'S FOR "FAST" AND "DUAL" TO TRUE
IF YOU INTEND TO RUN IT ON A DUAL PERSCI DRIVE.
SEE THE SOURCE LISTING FOR MORE INFORMATION.




STRIP.COM - This program strips a PRN FILE  back into an ASM FILE.
Command sequence is as follows:
STRIP <filename1> <filename2>
Where <filename1> is the PRN FILE and <filename2> is the
name of the ASM file you want. The extension .PRN is not needed
for <filename1>, nor is the extension .ASM needed for
<filename2>, as it is assumed that it is a PRN file you are
stripping, and it is an ASM file you are building.
The STRIP.ASM file is included for academic reasons and requires
CP/M's MACRO assembler to assemble it.
