How to Configure baZic for CP/M for Your System

Make a copy of the baZic distribution disk and file the master disk in a 
safe place. The Create Working Diskettes option on the Micro Decision should be 
used to do this.  

Turnkeying baZic

In the following example, we will turnkey and set upper memory limits for 10-digit 
software floating point baZic. We will load 10-digit software floating point baZic 
into memory, toggle on the turnkey byte (271), enter a one-line turnkey program 
to be saved as a part of baZic, exit baZic to CP/M and save the file "BAZIC10.COM," 
54 blocks long, on the disk to preserve these changes.

Either Sysgen the copy of the baZic disk or remove the CP/M boot disk from Drive A 
and place the copy of the baZic disk in Drive A and then do a warm boot (press CTRL 
and C keys simultaneously). The copy of the baZic distribution disk must be in 
Drive A to continue with the configuration.

Following is an example configuration of 10-digit software floating point baZic, 
56K CP/M (your responses are underlined):

   A>^C
   A>BAZIC10 <CR>
   READY
   FILL 271,0 <CR>
   READY
   10 CHAIN "MENU" <CR>
   BYE <CR>
   A>SAVE 54 BAZIC10.COM <CR>
   A>

baZic includes built-in cursor-addressing and clear screen commands/statements. 
If you want to run only existing NorthStar BASIC programs under baZic you do 
not need to use these features. So that baZic users with a variety of CRTs 
can use these cursor addressing and clear screen features, the baZic distribution 
disk includes a CRT configuration program, "CRT.002." In the following example we 
will configure 10-digit software floating point baZic for a SOROC IQ 120 terminal 
(your responses are underlined):

   COPYRIGHT 1981 - i - MICRO MIKE'S, INC.
   A>BAZIC10 <CR>
   READY
   LOAD CRT <CR>
   READY
   RUN <CR>

The program "CRT.002" will be executed. You will now see the following on the screen:

   THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO CONFIGURE BAZIC FOR A PARTICULAR CRT. 
   FOR THE PRINT@ AND THE CLS STATEMENTS TO WORK PROPERLY, BAZIC MUST KNOW 
   THE CURSOR-ADDRESSING PREFIX AND OFFSET FOR YOUR CRT AS WELL AS THE 
   CODES TO CLEAR THE SCREEN. THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO CHANGE BAZIC FOR 
   THE TERMINALS LISTED AND TO ALLOW CUSTOM CHANGES IF YOU KNOW THE CODES 
   FOR A CRT THAT IS NOT LISTED HERE. SOME CRTS MAY REQUIRE REWRITING THE 
   CURSOR ADDRESSING AND CLEAR SCREEN ROUTINES. THIS PROGRAM CAN BE CHANGED 
   SO THAT IT 'WRITES' THE PROPER ROUTINE BY ADDING AN ENTRY TO THE TABLE 
   OF DATA STATEMENTS AT THE END OF THIS PROGRAM. THE FIRST FIELD IS THE 
   NUMBER OF PAIRS THAT HAVE TO BE WRITTEN. EACH PAIR CONSISTS OF THE VALUE 
   TO BE WRITTEN AND THE NUMBER OF BYTES FROM THE BEGINNING OF BAZIC OF WHERE 
   THE BYTE IS TO BE WRITTEN.

   THE BAZIC DISK MUST BE IN DRIVE ONE FOR THIS PROGRAM TO OPERATE.

   PRESS RETURN TO CONTINUE

Press Return and the program will display a menu of 6 CRT options and an "other" option.

   1=ZENITH Z-19 OR HEATH WH-19
   2=ADM-3A
   3=INTERTEC INTERTUBE
   4=HAZELTINE
   5=SOROC
   6=NORTHSTAR ADVANTAGE
   7=DIGITAL VT-100
   8=OTHER

If your CRT is not one of those listed consult your CRT manual for the values 
of your CRT and/or your programmer. We will, for the purposes of this example, 
select 2 for ADM-3A.

Next you will see:

   1= 8 DIGIT SOFTWARE FLOATING POINT BAZIC
   2= 10 DIGIT SOFTWARE FLOATING POINT BAZIC
   3= 12 DIGIT SOFTWARE FLOATING POINT BAZIC
   4= 14 DIGIT SOFTWARE FLOATING POINT BAZIC
   5= 8 DIGIT HARDWARE FLOATING POINT BAZIC
   6= 10 DIGIT HARDWARE FLOATING POINT BAZIC
   7= 12 DIGIT HARDWARE FLOATING POINT BAZIC
   8= 14 DIGIT HARDWARE FLOATING POINT BAZIC

ENTER NUMBER OF BAZIC TO BE CHANGED (0 TO END) 2

We will select 2 for 10-digit software floating point baZic. (Hardware floating 
point baZic is for use with the NorthStar Floating Point Board.)

Now you will see:

   THIS LINE SHOULD BE AT THE TOP OF THE CRT AND THE REST OF THE SCREEN 
   SHOULD BE CLEAR. 1=YES, 0=NO 1

Enter 1 if the above sentence is at the top of the screen and the rest of 
the screen is clear. 

At this point a series of loop-de-loops will appear on the screen. Below 
the loop-de-loops the following will be displayed on the screen:

   THIS COMPLETES THE TEST. IF EVERYTHING IS OK THERE SHOULD
   BE A DISTINCT PATTERN FROM THE PREVIOUS !@ STATEMENTS
   ENTER 1= EVERYTHING IS OK, 0= NOT OK

If everything is okay enter 1 and the next prompt will be:

   READY

Configuration is now complete. To test the clear screen function type (your 
response is underlined):

   READY
   CLS <CR>

The screen should clear and 

   READY 

should appear at the top, left-hand corner of the screen.

Adapting baZic for operation under the MP/M I operating system:

The configuration process is the same as for CP/M.
For baZic to function under the MP/M I operating system, you must disable 
Control C. You can disable Control C by adding this line of code as the 
first line number in the first program to be run:

   1 FILL 280,1

You must either add this line of code to the program or FILL this location 
manually for baZic to operate under the MP/M I operating system. To disable 
Control C manually (your response is underlined):

   READY
   FILL 280,1 <CR>
   READY

baZic File Name Extensions

Under CP/M baZic programs will have a ".002" extension, e.g., "PROGRAM.002." 
baZic data files generally will have a ".003" extension, unless specified 
otherwise. Type 1 machine language programs will have a ".001" extension.

Moving NorthStar BASIC Programs and Data Files from a NorthStar DOS Disk 
Format to a CP/M Disk Format

A utility for moving NorthStar BASIC programs and data file from a 
NorthStar DOS disk format to a NorthStar CP/M disk format is available 
from Micro Mike's, Inc. COPYALL allows you to copy from a NorthStar DOS 
disk format to one of four different NorthStar CP/M floppy disk formats. 
COPYALL operates with the NorthStar Horizon only; the Advantage is not 
supported currently.

Machine Language Sort Subroutine and Powerful Editor for baZic

SZ Software Systems has developed a fast machine language sort subroutine 
which, once installed, becomes a part of baZic. N*SORT is many times faster 
than the fastest Shell-Metzner sort written in BASIC. N*SORT is available 
from Micro Mike's, Inc.

N*BUS is a powerful global editor for baZic. It is available from 
Micro Mike's, Inc.
