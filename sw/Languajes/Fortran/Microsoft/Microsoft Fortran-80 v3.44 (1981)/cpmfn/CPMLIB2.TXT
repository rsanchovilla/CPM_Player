This is a short guide to modifying the contents of CPMLIB.REL.

In the examples that follow, the "system disk" is assumed to be
on drive A:. That drive is assumed to contain the Microsoft
FORTRAN-80 package, including F80.COM, L80.COM, M80.COM and
LIB.COM.  The CPMLIB files are assumed to be on drive B:.


A)	CPMLIB structure

	CPMLIB.REL should be thought of as being divided into
	three levels of subroutines.  The first are the
	primary entry points from FORTRAN programs. These
	routines are all at the beginning of the library.
	Since there is no interdependence between them,
	they have been placed in alphabetical order.


	The second level contains various service routines
	for the primary entry point routines.  These are
	somewhat interdependent, and should be arranged so
	that a single search through the library can resolve
	all references.

	The last level contains the assembly language
	routines that perform the CP/M function calls.
	They should be last, since they can be called by
	any of the higher-level routines.

	The first two levels are written in FORTRAN and are
	contained in the file CPMINT.FOR which stands for
	CP/M INTerface.

	The third level routines are written in assembly
	and are contained in the files CPMFN.MAC and 
	CPMFNA.MAC.  CPMFN.MAC contains the BDOS calls,
	and CPMFNA.MAC contains the command line routine.
	Both of the assembly language routines assume a
	standard ORG 0000H version of CP/M.  If your CP/M
	has a different origin, you will need to reassemble
	these two routines.

B)	Adding or Changing Functions

	New functions can be added by writing the appropriate
	FORTRAN interface routine. That routine, and any support
	routines it needs, should be inserted into CPMINT.FOR.
	Then, recompile the entire FORTRAN file.

		A>F80 =B:CPMINT.FOR

	If new BDOS function calls are required, set the 
	appropriate equates in CPMFN.MAC and reassemble it.

		A>M80 =B:CPMFN.MAC

	Otherwise, you may need to write a new assembly language
	routine.

	You will also need to reassemble to change the CP/M
	origin if your version is not ORG 0000H.
	In this case, all .MAC files will need to be edited
	and reassembled.

	By convention, the high level routines are all written
	with no interdependence. They are inserted at the 
	beginning of the library in alphabetical order.

	The secondary FORTRAN routines all have names ending
	with a dollar sign ($).  They must be arranged so that
	a single search thru the library resolves all references.
	The ERROR$ routine is placed last in the FORTRAN section,
	since in the future any of the other routines may
	issue a call to it.

	The assembly routines are all named with a prefix of
	CPMF (for CP/M Function).  The BDOS functions are in
	the file CPMFN.MAC / CPMFN.REL and the entry points
	contain the BDOS function number -- CPMF19, for
	example, is the entry for BDOS function number 19.
	Additional routines are in files with alphabetic 
	suffixes.  The first (and only) file in this category
	is CPMFNA.MAC / CPMFNA.REL for command line processing.
	The second would be CPMFNB, etc.

	While not essential, this convention does define an
	orderly system for naming the routines in the library.

C)	Rebuilding the Library

	Once the new or modified routines are compiled and
	assembled, use the LIB-80 program to construct your
	new library.
	LIB works on the currently-logged drive, so log in
	to drive B: if that is where the CPMLIB files are.

		A>B:
		B>A:LIB
		*NEWLIB=CPMINT,CPMFN,CPMFNA
		*/E

	Test the new library.  If it is OK, then you can erase
	the old library and rename the new one.

		B>ERA CPMLIB.REL
		B>REN CPMLIB.REL=NEWLIB.REL
