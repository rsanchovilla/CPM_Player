The files in this package are a combination of two old libraries on
RATFOR (Rational Fortran).

Those with abbreviated titles (RF.COM, etc.) are from the older library
and the file TSW-RF.DOC is associated with them.  Note that the programs
CDS.COM and MAKCOM.COM are special purpose programs and should only be used
as described there.

The full title files (RATFOR.COM, etc.) are from a library obtained from
SIMTEL20 and are of later origin.

RATFOR.COM does not appear to be functioning properly.  That is, it will
not convert a file from command line entry, but does convert lines inter-
actively.  Don't know how to write it to a file, however.
