TURBO PASCAL 2.0 USERS
----------------------
     We  are  currently  shipping version 3.0  of  TURBO  PASCAL.
     The ACCESS.BOX file included on this diskette is intended to
     be used only with TURBO PASCAL 3.0 or later.  All the sample
     programs are set up for use by 3.0 users --  no installation
     is required.

     If you are still using  TURBO  PASCAL  2.0,  please  run the
     batch file  TURBO2.BAT.   To do this,  place a  COPY of your
     original master diskette in drive A, type "TURBO2" and press
     the <ENTER> key.

     Please note that the above applies to  16-bit  systems only.
     CP/M-80 users do not require an updated ACCESS.BOX file  to
     use with TURBO PASCAL 3.0 and only one  ACCESS.BOX file  is
     included on this diskette.

                             -----------

                             -----------

P- 1, Version 2.0
-----------------
     This is a painful typographical error!   The current version
     of the TURBO DATABASE TOOLBOX is Version 1.2.


P- 12, ACCESS.BOX, ACCESS2.BOX, ACCESS3.BOX  (MS-DOS only)
----------------------------------------------------------
     As explained above,  there are different ACCESS routines for
     TURBO PASCAL Versions 2.0 and 3.0:

      - Use ACCESS.BOX with TURBO PASCAL 3.0.  The TURBO DATABASE
        TOOLBOX is set up for 3.0 users -- no installation is re-
        quired.

      - Run TURBO2.BAT if you use TURBO  PASCAL 2.0.   This batch
        file completely installs the TURBO  DATABASE  TOOLBOX for
        2.0 users.

     Please note: The above applies to 16-bit systems only.    No
     special installation is required for  CP/M-80 TOOLBOX  users
     and only one ACCESS.BOX file is included on the distribution
     disk.


P- 19, Error message numbers
----------------------------
     The I/O error  numbers returned by IOresult when using TURBO
     PASCAL  Version  2.0 are different than those listed in  the
     TURBO PASCAL Reference Manual.  The following table converts
     these error numbers to the I/O  listed in  the manual.   The
     last error described by this table actually applies to TURBO
     PASCAL 3.0 users ONLY.

P- 22, Str[2]
-------------
     Str[2] should be String2 as it is defined  above.   The cor-
     rect declaration for both functions on this page is:

       function IntToStr(N : integer) : String2;

       function StrToInt(S : String2) : integer;


                             -----------

                                NOTES
                                -----

The following comments and suggestions  are also  included in the
manual.  They are listed here because they solve most of the prob-
lems reported to our technical support department.


SizeOf
------
     Care  must be taken when specifying the size of  your  keys,
     records  and  constants.   You should never count the  bytes
     manually.  Instead, use the function SizeOf to determine the
     actual size of your data structure and then type this  value
     into your  TOOLBOX  program.   Please see  page 15  of  your
     Owner's Handbook for more discussion.


FindKey & SearchKey
-------------------
     Note  that  the  key  field of  the  FindKey  and  SearchKey
     procedures  is a variable parameter.   Please see page 20 of
     your Owner's Handbook for more discussion.
