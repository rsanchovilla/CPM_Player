                 Turbo Pascal 3.01a Patch No. 1
                            27 Sep 89

Turbo  Pascal  misses a couple of chances to save the IX  and  IY  
registers around BIOS calls.  Some CP/M systems have BIOS's which  
also  use IX and IY without saving them.  Turbo Pascal  will  not  
run correctly on these systems.  Known to give trouble..

There  may  be  others  which also have  this  problem.   I  will  
appreciate it if you will advise me of any you know of.

The  accompanying TP-PAT01.COM will patch your TURBO.COM file  to  
preserve IX and IY around BIOS calls.  As always, this should  be  
done on a 'work' copy of TURBO.COM and not the original!

If  you  use  this  patch to advantage, please  drop  me  a  note  
detailing  which machine(s) you used it on.  If  TURBO.COM  still  
doesn't work for you, let me know that too.  Thank you.
