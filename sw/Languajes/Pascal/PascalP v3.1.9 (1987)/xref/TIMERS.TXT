The various "TIMxxx.MAC" files are overlays to access
the timer systems.  NOVERLAY removes the timer, thus
allowing overlayed programs to port to systems without
timers.  These overlays are usable on both .COM files
and RUNPCD.  (do not overlaya .PCD file). The complete
interface is described in CPMLINK
