.macro chttl = Compiler Error Messages
.ch .chttl
.hl 1 General
The  compiler  produces error codes,  and lists them after the  offending
line on both output and pasclist formal files.   If the L- option is in effect
output  to pasclist is suppressed.   If the translation file  (formally  "ef",
normally EF.  under CPM) is available a
list of error code translations follows.   Note that the position indicated in
the  source line is that in which the error was detected,  and that the actual
error may occur earlier. 

.hl 1 Action after errors
If any errors are found the compiler will set JCW (job control word)
to the error state, and
if  warnings  are  found it will set JCW to the warn state.  See the procedure
SETJCW under Extensions.  This is very useful when executing long compilations
under the various batch mechanisms .bb (JOB or SUBMIT under CPM).  Under CP/M
SETJCW  to  a
negative  value causes any submit job to be cancelled on program  termination,
and the warn state is ignored. .eb

.hl 1 Some conditions causing errors/warnings
The  compiler will always generate a warning if the standard files  INPUT
or OUTPUT are reset or rewritten (or the equivalent).  These files are 
normally  the  user console,  and cannot be reread nor can the effects  
of  previous writes be erased.

While  NIL is implemented as a predefined type,  the compiler will forbid
any attempts to redefine it, thus giving it the effective status of a reserved
word.

In  general the compiler will generate warnings where the actual  meaning
is  unambiguous (e.g.  use of a feature in the wrong mode,  attempts to  reset
input,  etc.) and errors wherever the possibility of a mis-spelling or  faulty
punctuation exists.

.hl 1 Accessing Error Messages
Under  CPM the error message file is accessed as file "EF" with a  blank
extension.   If  this file is not on the default or system disks it should  be
specified on the command line with the appropriate disk identifier,  otherwise
no  translation  will occur.
The error message file may be modified freely  (one
line per error) to install other languages, clarify errors, etc.
