.ch Standard Pascal Features Not Implemented
At present the following features of ANSI standard Pascal have not been
implemented.  All except "GOTO"s are planned for eventual inclusion.

.list 1
.le    Procedures/functions as parameters.
.le     GOTO's leading out of procedure/function bodies.
.le     Read/write for non-text files.
.endlist


.hl 1 Packing
"PACKED" variables may or may not necessarily be packed.  .bb At present
no items are packed no more than one item per byte. .eb

The  standard procedures PACK and UNPACK may be used,  but  may  actually
simply transfer variables.

PACKED and UNPACKED variables are not distinguished at present, although the
parameters to PACK and UNPACK must be correctly declared.  Thus standard
Pascal errors in usage of such variables probably will be undetected.
.hl 1 Set of Char
A  set of char is available,  but any attempt to include  graphics  
characters  in  that  set 
{e.g.  chars with ordinal values larger than  127}  will
result in a run-time error (if checking is enabled) or compilation errors  for
constants.
.hl 1 Separate Compilation
The  compiler  will handle partial source programs for separate  
compilation.   This  facility is described in the chapter on Language
Extensions  under
"Procedure Calls".  S- mode is required.

The PROGRAM statement is optional under S- mode.  If it is omitted, INPUT
and OUTPUT files are still available.  

.hl 1 Files in Structured Variables
The user must give special consideration to ARRAYS OF FILE,  RECORDS with
file  components,  and pointers to FILE types or other types with FILE 
components.   Before any programmatic reference to these items it 
is necessary to call the  standard procedure 
FILEINIT(f) for each and every file component.   After this the
system  will  function normally,  except that no automatic file close on  exit
from the block in which the file was declared will occur.   Again the user must
specifically execute the standard procedure CLOSE(f) for each file opened (via
reset/rewrite and equivalent procedures).  Under CP/m, if the file has only
been used for reading (opened via RESET or EXISTS) the final close is not
necessary.  However inclusion of the close statement will avoid portability
problems, and possible problems if program modifications are made later.
.hl 1 Reads of Real Variables
On input,  reads of real variables do not insist on a leading digit,  but
will accept values starting with ".".  This is deliberate, and avoids nuisance
run-time errors.
