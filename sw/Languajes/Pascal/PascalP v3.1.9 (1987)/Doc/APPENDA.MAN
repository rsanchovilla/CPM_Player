Six primary reasons (apply to both systems) :
.le    functional  and procedural parameters are not  implemented.
Affects tests: 
.cr .t           6.6.3.1-4   .t    6.6.3.4-1 .t      6.6.3.4-2 
.cr .t                 6.6.3.5-1 
.le Variables  are  identified by their initial 8  chars. only.  Affects:
.cr .t                 6.1.3-2  .t       6.4.3.5-11
.le (* *)  and {} comments are separate, and one type may
be nested within the other,  although comments of any
single type may not be nested. Affects:
.cr .t                 6.1.9-1
.le GOTO's  out  of a procedure/function  block  are  not
implemented.  Affects:
.cr .t                 6.8.2.4-1
.le     File types can be used in structured  variables,  but
only   if  the  system  special  standard   procedure
FILEINIT(f) is executed on each such file, i.e. array
of  file.   Test  is  successful  with  this  change.
Affects:
.cr .t                 6.4.3.5-4
.le     CASE table size restricted to 1000 entries. Affects:
.cr .t                 6.8.3.5-2


Implementation errors detected (both systems):
.le     Functional  values  may only be assigned  within  the
main function block. Affects:
.cr .t                 6.2.2-6
.le     Real output formatting is non-standard.
.cr .t                 6.9.3.5.1-1 .t    6.9.3.5.1-2

8080 CPM implementation errors detected:
.le     In the CPM file environment,  for non TEXT files, no
accurate  EOF marker is available.   Thus eof is  not
necessarily set after read-back from a non-text file.
6.4.3.5-11  already  failed  for  identifier  length.
Affects:
.cr .t                 6.4.3.5-5 .t      6.5.3.5-6 .t      6.4.3.5-7
.cr .t                 6.4.3.5-8 .t      6.5.3.5-9  .t     6.4.3.5-10
.cr .t                 6.4.3.5-11 .t     6.4.3.5-12
