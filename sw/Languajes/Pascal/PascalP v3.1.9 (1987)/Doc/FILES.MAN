.hl 1 General
A number of run time errors can occur while running Pascal programs.  The
messages  are  generally accompanied by a source code line number  if  the  N+
option was in effect on compilation.   File errors are also accompanied
by the file name.

Files  named in the Program line of the Pascal source are external to the
Pascal program.  They may be defined .bb by the run command, .eb or may be
temporary or
permanent user files.   Files declared within procedures are unnamed temporary
files (unless opened with a second parameter in the opening RESET or  REWRITE,
as described below).  The files "input" and "output" normally connect to
the user's console.

.hl 1 On 8080/z80 under CPM:
The program command line is normally of the form:

.i 5       d>RUNPCD program (fileparameters) [parm]; _<inputfile >outputfile

(with "RUNPCD" omitted for _.COM files) but is not restricted to that,
i.e. use of the command line is entirely under
the  control of the application program.   Any section after "program" may  be
omitted,  and defaults apply.  The file parameters replace the files mentioned
in  the Pascal PROGRAM heading.   If omitted the Pascal internal  filename  is
used.   Files input and output cannot be redirected by this mechanism, but use
the  "Unix" flavored "_<" and ">" (comesfrom and goesto) redirection  commands.
By  default input and output connect to the users console.  Parm is an integer
in the range 0..32767,  with a default value of 0.  Use is up to the executing
program,  however  odd values are used to cause an initial debug trap,  and to
enable various run-time debugging aids.  Thus it is suggested that application
programs rely primarily on even values.

.hl 2 CPM device files
Under CPM and other systems the following device files  are
normally  available (and their names cannot be used for other  files).  Unless
mentioned these are text files. Any devicefile may be used interchangably with
a disk file of the same type.
.rem end itemize with .res
.macro itemize = .sav .tabs 10 20 .p -10 1 5 .lm 20 .rm $$rm-10;
.itemize
.pp  CON .t    the system console, .bb buffered for input or output. .eb
.pp  KBD .t   the  system console keyboard,  without  buffering  or
echoing of input.   Correct use of this file requires
either modification to CPM 2.2. or (interpreters 2.8
up) prevents use of the  CNTRL-P CPM function.  This
avoids  loss of input characters during console  output. 
See the STATUS procedure.
.pp  RDR .t   The system "reader" device, line buffered.
.pp  PUN .t   The system "punch" device
.pp  LST .t   The system "list" device
.pp  AUX .t   Identical to RDR device with no line buffering. _<lf>s
are translated to _<nul>.  See STATUS procedure.
.pp  NUL .t   a null file (bit bucket).  Any type.
.pp  CMD .t   A one line file containing the run command line.
.res

Various other device files can exist at various installations.   Examples
are:
.itemize
.pp  KBB .t   Identical to KBD, except that "reset(kbb)" causes all
console  i/o to be performed through interrupt driven
buffers.   The  close operation on kbb (either  
specifically  performed  or by exit  from  the  declaring
procedure) restores the normal unbuffered drivers.
.pp  AD1..AD8 .t  A set of 8 analog/digital converters. FILE OF real.
.pp  RS1, RS2 .t   Direct access to RS232 i/o ports. See STATUS.
.pp  R1B, R2B .t   As RS1 and RS2, but buffered via interrupt system.
These  files will not cause "waits" in the  executing
program,  unless the buffers fill or are empty.  This
can be pre-checked with the STATUS function.
.res
.hl 2 File Redirection
Under .bb CPM .eb file redirection is  available,  by
substituting the desired files in the program header.   Files not specified by
this  method default to the Pascal filename.   A pair of commas can skip  file
redirection for any one file.   Note that INPUT and OUTPUT connect to "CON" by
default and cannot be redirected by this mechanism, but that the sequence

.i 10     A>RUNPCD progfile(whatever) _<inputfilename >outputfilename .b
.i 35            will redirect INPUT and OUTPUT.

.note NOTE
The "lf" character is normally ignored .bb  on input. .eb
However input of a lf will cause the STATUS function to return a
2 bit (see below) because the hardware is physically loaded.   If a get is now
performed  the system will flush the lf and perform the following get  
automatically.   This can cause unexpected delays when performing 
direct device I/O.
For this reason some device drivers are modified to translate lf into nul  and
the user must specifically discard it.   The AUX file translates all lf's into
nulls for this reason.
.res
.hl 2 Under CPM the file search order is:
.list 1
.le            The default disk,  if  no drive  specified,
.le         The system disk. .b
and then, for code files (.PCD) to be executed only:
.le            within the library file PCDS.LBR on the default disk.
.le         within the library file PCDS.LBR on the system disk ONLY
when no library was found on the default disk.
.endlist

If  a  drive  has been specified the search is limited to  the  specified
drive.   If  the  modified CCP and JOB (for submit) files are  installed  this
search order is implemented at all levels,  otherwise it is limited to  Pascal
program executions.

Files  INPUT and OUTPUT default to "CON" (the console) under  CPM.   See
above for run-time re-direction.
