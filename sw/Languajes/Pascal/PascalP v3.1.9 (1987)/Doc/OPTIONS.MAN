.macro chttl = Compiler Switches & Options
.ch .chttl
Pascal-P  recognizes  commands  placed in "pseudo-comments" of  the  form
(*$...*)  or  {$...}.   Options are separated by commas  with  no  intervening
spaces.  Unrecognized options will generate a warning.

Compiler options never affect the sense of the compiled program,  but may
alter the run-time environment.

The following options are available (* marks defaults):
.rem follow the itemized group with a .res command
.sav .tabs 5 13 15 .lm 15 .p -10 1 5 .rm $$rm-5;
.pp
@nnnn .t # .t (nnnn  is an unsigned integer) Sets initial value for
compiler generated labels.  Used with separate  
compilations  so that internal procedure names are unique
to segments.   Default 0.  Misuse can cause  unusable
code.  Always assign increasing values, and allow for usage
in earlier modules. .b
.pp
     B+ .t    * (default). Assign normal file buffer space.
.pp
     B- .t # .t   Assign  no file buffer space beyond that required for
file flags and access to f^.  Normally used only with
8080 and P-code interpreter systems for device  files
which are accessed directly.
.pp
     Bnnn .t # .t nnn is an unsigned integer.  Assign nnn units of file
buffer space.  Useful for special i/o drivers.
Note  that this option takes effect during  the  file
type definition.
.b .pp
     C+ .t   * (default). Emit object code.
.pp
     C- .t # .t   No object code. Useful for source syntax checks.
.b .pp
     D+ .t   * (default)  Emit run-time checks.
.pp
     D- .t # .t   No run-time checks.
.b .pp
     E+  .t # .t   Listing page eject.
.pp
     E-  .t # .t   Ignored.
.b .pp
     H+ .t # .t    Accept  extensions which allow compilation of  source
for Per Brinch Hansens Solo system.  Also sets the S-
option,  see below.  In this mode the " is recognized
as  a comment delimiter (start and  end),  VAR, CONST  and
TYPE declarations may be intermixed and "local" global
variables may be declared (invisible to earlier portions
of the source file), "OR" may be used
in place of "+" for set union,  and characters may be
defined  within  strings  by (:nn:) where nn  is  the
ordinal value of the character.  All but "(:nn:) within
strings and the "local module" VARS are
normally executed with warnings in other modes.
.pp
     H- .t  * (default) Reject the above extensions.  If the system
was in the H+ or S- modes it is left in the S- mode.
.b .pp
     I'filename'   A  second method for  including  other  source
files.   This  can  appear  with other options  in  a
single  line  (which must contain the *) or  }  char-
acters).  This mode avoids the line number setting to
a multiple of 1000 mentioned above,  and will not  be
tracked  by the XREF cross-referencer program  unless
the appropriate option bits are set.
.b .pp
     L+ .t   * (default). Generate a listing file.
.pp
     L- .t # .t   suppress listing until an L+ command encountered.
.b .pp
     N+ .t   * (default). Emit source line numbers in object code.
.pp
     N- .t # .t   No tracing line numbers.
.b .pp
     P+ .t   * (default). Allow use of nonstandard std procs.
.pp
     P- .t # .t   Warnings  whenever any non-standard "standard  
Procedure" encountered.
.b .pp
     S+ .t   * (default)  Warnings  and/or errors signalled for  any
use of nonstandard Pascal features, but not including
use of nonstandard "standard procedures".
.pp
     S-  .t # .t   enables use of nonstandard Pascal features  including
definition of character constants by (:nn:), where nn
is  the  ordinal value of the character,  use of  the
substring construct ARRAY[VAR FOR CONST],  use of the
second  parameter  in  reset/rewrite  and  equivalent
procedures, use of "OTHERWISE" in case statements.
.pp
     S'segmentname'  Controls segmentation of the generated code.
Must appear outside the BEGIN END; of a procedure and
before the BEGIN of the main program block.
.b .pp
     T+ .t # .t   Print  compiler internal tables,  showing  variables,
types, etc.
.pp
     T- .t   * (default) Suppress table printing.
.b .pp
     W+ .t   * (default) Truncate input source at 80 characters.
.pp
     W- .t # .t   Truncate input source at 72 characters
.pp
     Wnnn .t # .t (nnn  is an unsigned integer).  Truncate input source
at nnn characters.  nnn _<= 108.
.b .pp
     X+ .t # .t   save  option setting for  future  restoration.   This
allows  modules  to set options as  desired,  without
affecting option settings for the including text.
.pp
     X- .t # .t  restore  option  setting saved by previous  X+.   Note
that only one level of storage is available.   An  X-
without a preceding X+ restores the default settings.
.b .pp
     Y+ .t # .t    Not  for user use.   Enables ic listing on prr  file,
and  renders that file unusable for code  generation.
For compiler debugging only.
.pp
     Y- .t   * (default). Normal compiler operation.
.b .pp
     Z+ .t # .t   Not for user use.  Controls phase-in of new features,
which may vary or be nonexistent, and may not work.
.pp
     Z- .t  * (default).  Undocumented features etc. are disabled.
.b .pp
     ^+ .t # .t    As  T+,  except that pointer variables and types  are
traced through all nesting levels.
.pp
     ^- .t  * (default)  No  effect unless ^+ was in  effect,  when
effectively sets T+ option.
