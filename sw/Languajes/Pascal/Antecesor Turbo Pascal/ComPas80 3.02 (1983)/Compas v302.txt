NAME      Set current file name.        EDIT      Invoke the editor.
COMPILE   Compile the source text.      RUN       Run current program.
PROGRAM   Compile to program file.      OBJECT    Compile into object file.
FIND      Find a run-time error.        WHERE     Restart editor.

MEMORY    Display memory size.          ZAP       Zap (delete) source text.
HELP      Display help screens.         QUIT      Return to CP/M.

Note that all commands may be abbreviated to their first letter.

For further help on the commands above, enter 'HELP' or 'H' followed by the
command name (or the first character of it).

The EDIT command.

The EDIT command invokes the on-screen editor. Once you are in the editor, a
list of editor commands may be displayed by pressing CTRL/J.

The LOAD command.

The LOAD command is used to load a source text into memory. The command line
format is:

        LOAD <filename>

If the file type is omitted, it defaults to '.PAS'. The current file name is
set to <filename>. When a file is loaded, it is appended to the end of the
source text already in memory. If the file specified does not exist, COMPAS
displays 'No such file'. If loading the file would overflow the memory buffer,
COMPAS displays 'File too big'. For both errors, the text already in memory
remains unchanged.

The SAVE command.

The SAVE command is used to save the text in memory in a disk file. The com-
mand line format is:

        SAVE <filename>

If <filename> is omitted entirely, it defaults to the current file name set by
LOAD or NAME. If the file type is omitted, it defaults to '.PAS'. If a file of
the same name and type exists on the disk specified, its type is changed to
'.BAK' before the new file is created. If the disk directory is full, COMPAS
displays 'Directory is full'. If there is not enough room on the disk to cre-
ate a new file, COMPAS displays 'Disk is full'. If one of these errors are re-
ported, insert another disk, log it in using the USE command, any try SAVE
again.

The NAME command.

The NAME command is used to change the current file name. The current file
name is used by SAVE, PROGRAM, and OBJECT when a file name is not explicitly
stated. The command line format is:

        NAME <filename>

If <filename> is omitted entirely, NAME displays the current file name instead
of changing it. If the file type is omitted, it defaults to '.PAS'.

The current file name is set to 'WORK.PAS' when COMPAS is cold-started and
when a ZAP command is issued.

The COMPILE command.

When the compiler is invoked from a COMPILE command, the object code is stored
directly into memory in succession of the source text.

Following a successful compilation you are informed of the size of the object
code, the size of free memory and the size of the data area:

        Code: rrrrr bytes (aaaa-bbbb)
        Free: sssss bytes (cccc-dddd)
        Data: ttttt bytes (eeee-ffff)

The numbers displayed in parentheses are the start and end addresses (in hex)
of each specific area.

Note that whenever you invoke the editor, the object code is erased.

The RUN command.

The RUN command is used to execute a program. If no program code is present,
the compiler is invoked to compile the program (see 'HELP COMPILE' text).
Assuming a successful compilation, or if the object code was already present,
the program is started. When it ends, it automatically transfers control to
the command mode.

If a run time error occurs, the program will terminate displaying a run time
error message, for instance:

        EXECUTION ERROR 04 AT PC=254E
        Program terminated

You may then use the FIND command to locate the statement that caused the
error (see 'HELP FIND' text).

The PROGRAM command.

The PROGRAM command is used to compile the program into a command file on a
disk. The command line formats is:

        PROGRAM <filename>,<origin>,<top>

If <filename> is omitted, the current file name is used, with its type changed
to '.COM'. The file type defaults to '.COM'. <origin> and <top> are hex num-
bers (up to four hex digits). Any one of them may be omitted, for instance
'PROGRAM TEST,4000' (only <origin>) or 'PROGRAM ,,C000' (only <top>).

<origin> specifies the start address of the object code. If it is omitted, the
end address of the runtime package is assumed. <top> specifies the top of mem-
ory for the program. Programs will never access locations above this address.
If <top> is omitted, the current logical top of memory is assumed. Since the
compiler allocates storage for variables starting at the top of memory and
working downwards, programs compiled for a given memory size cannot be run on
systems with smaller memory sizes. On compiling the program, COMPAS writes a
copy of the runtime package into the command file. Once compiled, the program
can be executed from CP/M simply by typing its name.

The OBJECT command.

The OBJECT command produces an object file which contains the compiled program
code only (the runtime package is not included). The command line format is:

        OBJECT <filename>,<origin>,<top>

If <filename> is omitted, the current file name is used, with its type changed
to '.OBJ'. The file type defaults to '.OBJ'. The <origin> and <top> parameters
correspond to those of the PROGRAM command (see 'HELP PROGRAM' text). Object
files may only be activated through the chain procedure of COMPAS Pascal. For
further details on program chaining, please refer to the COMPAS Pascal Prog-
ramming Manual.

The FIND command.

The FIND command is used to locate a statement in the source text which cor-
responds to an offset address in the object code. The command line format is:

        FIND <offset>

where <offset> is the offset address of the statement to be located. The off-
set address must be specified in hex (up to four hex digits). <offset> may be
omitted, in which case it defaults to the offset address of the last run time
error. Thus, to locate the statement that caused a run time error, simply en-
ter 'FIND'.

If the offset address is found, the compiler stops and displays 'Target ad-
dress found' followed by 'Press <RETURN> to edit or <ESC> to abort. When you
press RETURN, the editor is invoked, and the cursor is placed at or just after
the relevant section. If the offset is out of range, the compiler outputs
'Target address not found'.

The WHERE command.

The WHERE command invokes the editor, and moves the cursor to a specific posi-
tion in the text. The command line format is:

        WHERE <offset>

where <offset> is a hex number specifying the offset address of the spot to be
located. Whenever you leave the editor, the offset address of the cursor is
recorded as the default <offset> value. Thus, if you use WHERE (without an ar-
gument) instead of EDIT to invoke the editor, the cursor will be moved to the
spot you left previously instead of to the beginning of the text. In addition,
when the compiler reports an error, it also records the offset address of the
error as the default WHERE argument. In this case, WHERE without an argument
will invoke the editor and move the cursor to the spot in error.

The DIR command.

The DIR command is used to display the directory of a disk. The command line
format is:

        DIR <afn>

where <afn> is an ambiguous file name as the one used in a CP/M DIR command,
i.e. question marks (?) and asterisks (*) may be interspersed through the file
name and type fields.

A question mark will match any character in that position, and an asterisk will
match any combination of characters within the field in which it is used. If
both the name field and the type field are omitted, leaving only a drive iden-
tifier and a colon, then all files on that drive are listed. If <afn> is omit-
ted entirely, then all files of the currently logged drive are listed.

Note that system files are not displayed.

The USE command.

The USE command is used to log in new disks, and to change the currently log-
ged drive and user number. The command line format is:

        USE <drive><user>

where <drive> is a drive identifier (A-P), and <user> is a user number (0-15).
If <drive> is specified, the currently logged drive is changed, and if <user>
is specified, the current user number is changed. The USE command ends by dis-
playing the currently logged drive and user number.

Whenever a disk is changed in one of the drives, a USE command should be is-
sued to log in that disk. Otherwise, CP/M will report an R/O error if you try
to write to that disk.

The MEMORY command.

The MEMORY command displays the size of free memory:

        Free: rrrrr bytes (aaaa-bbbb)

The numbers in parentheses are the start and end addresses (in hex) of the
unused area.

The ZAP command.

The ZAP command erases the text in memory and sets the current file name to
'WORK.PAS'. As a safety precaution, ZAP asks 'Are you sure (Y/N)?'. Any answer
but 'Y' or 'y' will leave the text unchanged.

The QUIT command.

The QUIT command transfers control to CP/M. You may later warm-start COMPAS
by entering 'COMPAS *'. This of course requires that no vital memory areas
have been overwritten by other programs run it the meantime.
