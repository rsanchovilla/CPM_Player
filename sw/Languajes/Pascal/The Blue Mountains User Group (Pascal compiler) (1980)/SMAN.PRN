    (This is intended a suplement to the FAST users manual) 


SPEED  is  esentially  FAST  with  a copy of the CCP written by
Digital Research.   For  this  reason,  distribution  of  SPEED
should  be  limited  to  those  who are licensed users of CP/M.
Except for this restriction, SPEED is considered public  domain
software.


One  notable difference between FAST and SPEED is the length of
time that they remain in your system.  FAST is present only for
the execution of one transient.   SPEED,  on  the  other  hand,
stays  in  your  system  until you cold boot or type control-A.
SPEED prompts with '>A>' (get it?  greater than A> heh heh)  as
a  constant reminder that it is in control.  You should allways
be aware that SPEED is control because, like FAST, it  disables
the  disk  change detection built into BDOS.  It is possible to
clobber a disk by switching disks and not  booting.   Control-C
does  nothing  except  reset  BDOS  under SPEED.  When you must
change disks, type control-B to reset SPEED.
