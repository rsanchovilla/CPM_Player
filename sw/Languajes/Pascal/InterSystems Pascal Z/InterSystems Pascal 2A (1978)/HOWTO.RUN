COMPILER OPERATION UNDER CP/M


To run the compiler type:

	PASCAL <filename>.<source drive><output drive><listing drive>

where,

	<filename> is the file name of a text file with the extension PAS

	<source drive> is the letter naming the drive that the source file
		       is on.  The currently logged-in drive is the default.

	<output drive> is the letter naming the drive to which the Z80 code
       		       generated by the compiler should be sent.  The default 
		       is the currently logged-in drive.

	<listing drive> is the letter naming the drive to which the
		        pascal listing should go.  The currently logged-in
		        drive is the default.

A space in place of an option letter specifies the default.

EXAMPLES

A>PASCAL PRIMES

This will compile the text file PRIMES.PAS on drive A.  PRIMES.LST (the 
program listing) and PRIMES.SRC (the Z80 assembler code) will be sent to
drive A.

B>PASCAL PRIMES.ABC

This will compile the text file PRIMES.PAS on drive A.  PRIMES.SRC will be
sent to drive B.  PRIMES.LST will be sent to drive C.

B>PASCAL PRIMES. A

This will compile the text file PRIMES.PAS on drive B (the default).
PRIMES.SRC will be sent to drive A.  The listing file will be
sent to drive B (the default).

























ASSEMBLER OPERATION

ASMBL is a multi-input-file Z80 macro assembler for use with the
Pascal/z compiler.
To run the assembler type:

	ASMBL <fn>.<opts>,<fn>.<opts>,<fn>.<opts> ...

where

	<fn> is a text file with the extension SRC

	<opts> is an optional options list up to 3 letters long.

	first letter:	drive to get source code from.

	second letter:	drive to send hex file to.

	third letter:	drive to send listings.  If this letter
			is omitted, no listing will be generated.  If
			the letter is X, the listing will be sent to the
			console instead of the disk.


If more than one file is specified, they will be assembled as though they
were one large file.  The order in which they are listed in the command line
is the order in which they would appear in this large file (note: no 'large
file' is ever really created).  If an option is not specified, or if
a space is used in place of a letter, the default drive is used.  The
exception to this is the listing file: if a space is used, a listing file
will be created on the default drive, if if nothing is specified, no
file will be created.



EXAMPLE

A>ASMBL LIBS,PRIMES

Assemble LIBS.SRC (the uncommented version of the run-time library for Pascal/z) 
with PRIMES.SRC (the output of the compiler when it compiles PRIMES.PAS).
Get both files from drive A and send PRIMES.HEX to drive A.  No
listing file is generated because no drive letter was specified for it.

C>ASMBL LIBS.A,PRIMES. BX

Assemble the file LIBS.SRC on drive A with PRIMES.SRC on drive C. Send 
PRIMES.HEX to drive B.  Send the listing to the console.
