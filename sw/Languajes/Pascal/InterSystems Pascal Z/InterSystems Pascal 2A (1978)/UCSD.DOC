; Syntax PASTOCPM    <CP/M filename>   <Pascal filename>
;
; Transferrs the Pascal filename on a Pascal disk in B
;    to the CP/M filename.  If the CP/M file already exists,
;    you will be asked for permission to overwrite.
; If Pascal file is a .TEXT file, then two blocks are skipped
;    and indents replaced by spaces.  LFs are added after CR.
; If Pascal file is a .CODE file, then one block is skipped.
; If neither .CODE or .TEXT, copy is exact.
;
; Pascal disk in B; CP/M disk in A.
;
NOTE: Use UCSD64 if you have a 64K CP/M system, UCSD60 if you have a
      60K CP/M system, and UCSD56 if you have a 56K CP/M system.

      This program uses the standard CP/M BIOS entry points.
