DEMOACK is an implementation of Ackermann's function, an 
interesting example of recursion.  It may appeal to the more 
matematically inclined, whose appetites have been whetted by 
DEMOFACT.  The function ACK accepts two variables
M and N, and supplies the following result

  N+1 if M is zero,
  otherwise ACK( M-1,1 ) if N is zero,
  otherwise ACK( M-1, ACK ( M,N-1) ).

This function calls itself a non-intuitively large number of 
times for almost all values of M and N, and in fact ACK (3,8) or
ACK (4,1) are impractical requests on most systems.  
 
DEMOACK prompts the user for an M,N pair and prints the value of
ACK (M,N) as well as the number of times that ACK was called and
the maximum recursion depth reached during the evaluation. Start 
with values like (1,0) and work up, being patient and maybe 
developping a feel for the function's behavior. Don't forget
about control\ to abort 'looping' executions.
Why does ACK(3,7) require 693964 evaluations of ACK?
