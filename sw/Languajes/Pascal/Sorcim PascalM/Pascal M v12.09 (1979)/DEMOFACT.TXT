DEMOFACT is an introduction to recursive functions.  It computes
M factorial (the product of all positive integers less than or 
equal to M) by the recursive method:

  fact(m) = m * fact (m-1) .

Although not the computationally most desirable method for this
particular function, it is an excellent educational exercise 
because the algorithm is so clear.  (For an example of a less 
simplistic recursive algorithm, see DEMOACK.)  

DEMOFACT also demonstrates the PASCAL/M long_integer 16-bit data
type which accomodates up to 12 factorial, and the Pascal real
data type which takes over at 13 to yield floating-point 
approximations of the result.

DEMOFACT prompts for a number, and prints that number factorial.
