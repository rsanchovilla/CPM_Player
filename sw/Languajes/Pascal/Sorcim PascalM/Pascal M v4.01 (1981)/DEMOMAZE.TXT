DEMOMAZE is adapted from an article in the September/October
1980 issue of COMPUTE! Magazine.  The article, by J.H. Budge, is 
titled "Thesus (sic) Versus the Minotaur: Pascal Visits Ancient
Greece", and is a clever maze game, where the user supplies a maze
containing the Minotaur, and the program plays Theseus off
to find him.  The article (reprint included with the kind per-
mission of COMPUTE magazine) and program were originally in-
tended for a 6502-based microcomputer audience.  It is a
testimony to the power of standardizations that the published
code with no changes will run under PASCAL/M.

The program as published requires that the user input a maze
to the program.  While this is a most interesting mode to run
this program in, we have added two pre-defined mazes.  These
are the mazes illustrated as figures 1 and 3 in the Budge
article.  DEMOMAZE will prompt the user to indicate either
of these two, or a user-defined maze.

This program is interesting from a Pascal programming standpoint
because of the use of records and pointers to represent the
stack structure of Theseus' path.  This would be extremely
dificult to convey in a more primitive language.  Try it!
