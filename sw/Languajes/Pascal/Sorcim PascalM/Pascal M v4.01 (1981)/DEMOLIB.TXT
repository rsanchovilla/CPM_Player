DEMOLIB is the start of a "roll-your-own" record (the musical
kind) library program.  The problems introduced by the 
irregularity of records (a classical record may have one
symphony on it, and a conducter and orchestra of interest; while
a jazz anthology may have 10 pieces and 10 performers) are ideal
candidates for Pascal records (the structural kind).

DEMOLIB sets up some possible catagories of interest as 
types, and manipulates some of those.  The program prompts
the user for piece 'descriptions' of classical music, asking
for a musical form category, a musical period category (one
letter code each), and a composer name.  Enter a few made up
piece descriptions and give the program an X to exit. It will
sort the records you described alphabetically by composer, and
list the sorted names at the console.

Feel free to experiment with the structures in tailoring your 
own library program.  The sort may be of some interest. It 
uses an algorithm called 'quicksort' (first named by 
C.A.R. Hoare).  The algorithm appears many times in the
literature, but a most appropriate reference to it may be
found in the highly recommended "Algorithms+Data Structures=
Programs" by Nicklaus Wirth (Prentice Hall, 1976).  This
text uses Pascal to illustrate fundamental programming
structures and concepts that will be of interest to any
serious student of programming methodology.
