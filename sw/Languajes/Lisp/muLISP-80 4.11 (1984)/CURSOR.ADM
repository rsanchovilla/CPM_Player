% To adapt muSTAR for the ADM-3A terminal, change the name of
  this file from CURSOR.ADM to CURSOR.LIB using the operating
  system's REName command.  Next start up muLISP and following the
  dollar-sign prompt, issue the commands

	$ (RDS 'MUSTAR 'LIB)  (SAVE 'MUSTAR)  RETURN NIL

  This will read in and save muSTAR as a SYS file on the logged
  drive.  Then the muSTAR header message and menu will be displayed,
  indicating that muSTAR is ready to accept commands as described
  in the muLISP Reference Manual. %

% Although not required by muSTAR, CURSOR is a useful utility
  function.  CURSOR[row,col] repositions the cursor to row <row>
  and column <col>.  The upper left hand corner of the screen
  is row 0, column 0.  The maximum value of <row> is 23 and the
  maximum value of <col> is 79. %
