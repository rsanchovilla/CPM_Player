            Welcome to the world of Structured High-Level Microcomputer 
            Programming!! This document is intended as a quick guide to using the 
            BDS C Compiler package. 

                    ====================================================
                    Note to TRS-80 owners and other users having an
                    upper-case only console I/O device: Two programs
                    have recently been added to the package, CONVERT.C
                    and CC0T.C, to allow you to represent those characters
                    not normally available on your keyboards. See the
                    last part of this file for details.
                    ====================================================

            The main components of the BDS C package are: four executable COM 
            files, a standard library file and a skeletal run-time subroutine 
            module.

            A description of each follows:

            CC1:    Because C loads the entire source file into memory in one  
                    shot, the compilation is broken up into two phases (not  
                    "passes", strictly; The two phases end up taking about 8  
                    "passes" to actually implement), maximizing the amount of  
                    memory available for the source file. CC1, the first phase of  
                    the compiler, accepts a C source file with any filename and  
                    extension (say, "foo.c") and produces a temporary file  
                    containing a symbol table and an encoded form of the source  
                    code. By default, version 1.3 will leave the temporary  file  
                    in RAM and attempt to load in the next phase of the compiler  
                    (CC
